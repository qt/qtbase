Qt 5.2 introduces many new features and improvements as well as bugfixes
over the 5.1.x series. For more details, refer to the online documentation
included in this distribution. The documentation is also available online:

  http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.2

The Qt version 5.2 series is binary compatible with the 5.1.x series.
Applications compiled for 5.1 will continue to run with 5.2.

Some of the changes listed in this file include issue tracking numbers
corresponding to tasks in the Qt Bug Tracker:

****************************************************************************

Qt is now compiled with qreal typedef'ed to double on all platforms. qreal
was a float on ARM chipsets before. This guarantees more consistent behavior
between all platforms Qt supports, but is binary incompatible to Qt 5.1
on ARM. The old behavior can be restored by passing -qreal float to
configure.

****************************************************************************


QtWidgets
---------

- QAbstractScrollArea now has a SizeAdjustPolicy. If it is set to AdjustToContents
  it will make use of the protected viewportSizeHint() virtual function. This
  function returns a suggested size based on contents. Note that although the
  viewportSizeHint() virtual function was reserved in 5.0, user code was not
  supposed to be overriding it (as the function was private and undocumented).
  Code that was overriding viewportSizeHint() needs to be recompiled against 5.2
  for this feature to work correctly.

- QTreeView now has setTreePosition to allow the treestructure to show data from other
  columns than logicalindex zero.

- [QTBUG-4206] QTableView resizeToContents will now adjust to actual contents
  and not just visible area. QHeaderView::setAutoResizePrecision() has been
  introduced to control how precise the autoResize should be.

- QFileDialog::setDefaultSuffix() removes leading dot characters.

- [QTBUG-34132] QFileDialog does not instantiate widgets if a native dialog
  will be used instead.  Therefore some accessors which previously returned
  unused objects will now return null.  As before, you can set the
  DontUseNativeDialog option to ensure that widgets will be created and used instead.

- QSizePolicy got a retainSizeWhenHidden attribute.

- [QTBUG-31602] QSpinBox size calculation will now be fixed when stylesheets are
  used.

QtCore
------
- [QTBUG-30250] QTime, QDateTime:
  When calling QTime::toString(Qt::TextDate) and QTime::toString(Qt::ISODate),
  milliseconds are now included in the returned string. This also applies to
  QDateTime::toString(Qt::TextDate) and QDateTime::toString(ISODate).

- QtAlgorithms
  With STL no longer being optional for building and using Qt, a number of parts
  of QtAlgorithms no longer make sense, and have therefore been deprecated.

  Replacements are available in the STL, and generally have much better
  performance, but are not instantly source-compatible in all cases. For
  instance, specialization of qLess or qSwap means that a direct port to
  std::sort from qSort may not be possible, as std::sort does not use any of
  them; a possible workaround is explicitly passing a qLess functor to
  std::sort:

      std::sort(container.begin(), container.end(), qLess<T>());

  The functions in QtAlgorithms that have been deprecated, along with their
  STL counterparts, are:
    - qBinaryFind (std::binary_search / std::lower_bound)
    - qCopy (std::copy)
    - qCopyBackward (std::copy_backward)
    - qEqual (std::equal)
    - qFill (std::fill)
    - qFind (std::find)
    - qCount (std::count)
    - qSort (std::sort)
    - qStableSort (std::stable_sort)
    - qLowerBound (std::lower_bound)
    - qUpperBound (std::upper_bound)
    - qLess (std::less)
    - qGreater (std::greater)

QtGui
-----
- [QTBUG-28228] Session Management:
  The new QPlatformSessionManager class brings back the session management
  functionality. It allows the implementation of platform specific behavior
  related to session management. For platform that don't support this
  feature the default behavior has not changed.
  Both X11 and Windows session management are supported.

QtNetwork
---------

- API was added to store and resume TLS session tickets.

- The minimum support openssl version has been increased to openssl 1.0. The
  code to support older versions has not been removed, but is no longer
  supported.

- An off-by-one error in NTLM proxy authentication has been fixed.

- Various improvements to reduce the memory used by qtnetwork have been made.

- Improved support for HTTP proxy authentication.

- Support for preconnecting to servers before making HTTP and HTTPS
  connections. This allows for much reduced latency when the hosts to be
  connected to are known.

QtSql
-----
Changes in Qt 5.1.0 (missing from released changelog dist/changes-5.1.0)
- [QTBUG-28088] Remove dependency of DB driver headers on qsqlcachedresult_p.h.
- Deprecate QSqlError setters.
  The constructor is sufficient, since it has a parameter for each member variable.
- Rename the SQL driver header files to _p.h (make private)
  The drivers were never public API. They were exposed by mistake in
  public headers. What's more, they have #include'd a private header
  (qsqlcachedresult_p.h) since at least Qt 4.5.1. That means no one used
  those headers in Qt 4 (private headers weren't installed then) and
  it's unlikely anyone did in 5.0.
- ODBC: Implemented lastInsertId() for some ODBC compatible databases.
- PSQL: Make lastInsertID work for tables without OIDs.
- [QTBUG-14904] SQLITE: Fix for Sql query aliases with dots
- [QTBUG-2192] ODBC: fix loss of milliseconds when binding QDateTime
- [QTBUG-30076] PSQL: escape backslashes only when server requires it
  IMPORTANT: Applications that implemented their own workarounds must be
  updated to avoid misbehavior and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- [QTBUG-10569] ODBC: fixed QODBCResult::exec() return value for DELETE
  operations when no rows are affected.
- ODBC: Fixed loss of column metadata on SQL_NO_DATA.
- QSqlTableModel: expose methods for getting primary values.
- ODBC: Fixed possible cause of spurious errors (commit af35ee291a1bbbc8)

Changes in Qt 5.2.0
- [QTBUG-29261] IBASE: Construct a valid QTime when creating timestamps for iBase SQL driver.
- [QTBUG-33389] PSQL: Format QDateTime following ISO8601.
- Add QSQLITE_OPEN_URI option to QSQLITE driver

Qt for Android
--------------
 - Project structure and deployment has changed with the introduction of
   androiddeployqt. Source and build files are no longer mixed, and the
   build files for the APK package should not be touched. Customizing
   the build files is possible. Read the documentation for androiddeployqt
   for more information.

 - Status bar visibility is now controlled by Qt, so the window state will
   override settings in the AndroidManifest.xml. The default is still to
   show the status bar (QWindow::showMaximized()). Use
   QWindow::showFullScreen() to hide it.
