//! [displayName]

    Returns a localized display name for the given location \a type
    or an empty QString if no relevant location can be found.

//! [displayName]


//! [findExecutable]

    Finds the executable named \a executableName in the specified
    \a paths, or the system paths if paths is empty.

    On most operating systems the system path is determined by the
    \c PATH environment variable. The directories where to search for
    the executable can be set in the paths argument. To search in
    both your own paths and the system paths, call findExecutable
    twice, once with paths set and once with paths empty.
    Symlinks are not resolved in order to preserve behavior for the
    case of executables whose behavior depends on the name they are
    invoked with
    .
    \note On Windows, the usual executable extensions (from the PATHEXT
    environment variable) are automatically appended. For example, the
    findExecutable("foo") call finds \c foo.exe or \c foo.bat if
    present.

    Returns the absolute file path to the executable, or an empty
    string if not found.

    If the given \n executableName is an absolute path pointing to
    an executable its clean path is returned.

//! [findExecutable]

//! [locate]

    Finds a file or directory called \a fileName in the standard
    locations for \a type.

    The \a options flag lets you specify whether to look for files
    or directories. By default, this flag is set to \c LocateFile.

    Returns the absolute path to the first file or directory found,
    otherwise returns an empty string.

//! [locate]

//! [locateAll]

    Finds all files or directories by the name, \a fileName, in the
    standard locations for \a type.

    The \a options flag lets you specify whether to look for files
    or directories. By default, this flag is set to \c LocateFile.

    Returns the list of all the files that were found.

//! [locateAll]

//! [setTestModeEnabled]

    If \a testMode is \c true, this enables a special "test mode" in
    QStandardPaths, which changes writable locations to point to
    test directories. This prevents auto tests from reading
    or writing to the current user's configuration.

    It affects the locations into which test programs might write
    files: \c GenericDataLocation, \c AppDataLocation, \c ConfigLocation,
    \c GenericConfigLocation, \c AppConfigLocation,
    \c GenericCacheLocation, and \c CacheLocation. Other locations
    are not affected.

    On Unix, \c XDG_DATA_HOME is set to \c{~/.qttest/share},
    \c XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to \c{~/.qttest/config}, and
    \c XDG_CACHE_HOME is set to \c{~/.qttest/cache}.

    On macOS, data goes to \c{~/.qttest/Application Support},
    cache goes to \c{~/.qttest/Cache}, and config goes to
    \c{~/.qttest/Preferences}.

    On Windows, everything goes to a "qttest" directory under
    \c{%APPDATA%}.

//! [setTestModeEnabled]

//! [standardLocations]

    Returns all the directories where files of \a type belong.

    The list of directories is sorted from high to low priority,
    starting with writableLocation() if it can be determined.
    This list is empty if no locations for type are defined.

//! [standardLocations]

//! [writableLocation]

    Returns the directory where files of \a type should be written to,
    or an empty string if the location cannot be determined.

    \note The storage location returned may not exist; that is,
    it may need to be created by the system or the user.

//! [writableLocation]
