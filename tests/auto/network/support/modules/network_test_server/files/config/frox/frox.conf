# Configuration file for frox transparent ftp-proxy.

# Send SIGHUP after editing and it will be reread. This will fail
# completely if we are chrooted and the config file isn't within the
# dir we have chrooted to, or if we have dropped priveleges and no

# be reread - namely those which require special privelidges (ie. 
# BindToDevice, Listen, Port, TransparentData) and the caching stuff.

# Block PORT commands asking data to be sent to ports<1024 and

#
BounceDefend yes

# If true then only accept data connections from the hosts the control
# connections are to. Breaks the rfc, and defaults to off.
#
# SameAddress yes

# Normally frox strips out nonprintable characters from the control
# stream. This makes buffer overflow attacks on clients/servers much more
# difficult. If you download files that contain non english characters
# this may cause you problems (especially for big charsets like Chines).
# In that case turn on this option.
#
# AllowNonASCII yes

# Try to transparently proxy the data connections as well. Not
# necessary for most clients, and does increase security risks. N.V.
# You probably do _NOT_ need this option. It increases the complexity
# of what frox has to do, increases the difficulty of setting frox up
# correctly, and increases potential security risks. This has nothing
# to do with whether your clients will be transparently proxied. If
# you still want to use this option then read README.transdata for
# details.
#
# TransparentData yes

# Specify ranges for local ports to use for outgoing connections and
# for sending out in PORT commands. By default these are all between
# 40000 and 50000, but you might want to split them up if you have

# Caching options. There should be at most one CacheModule line, and

# Allow non-transparent proxying support. The user can connect
# directly to frox, and give his username as user@host:port or
# user@host. Defaults to no. NTPAddress gives the address to which
# incoming connections must be addressed if the client is to be offered
# non-transparent proxying. For most people using this it will be the same
# as the Listen address above. If not given then all connections will be
# offered non transparent proxying. If you are not using transparent
# proxying at all then you should leave NTPAddress commented out.
#
DoNTP yes

# Number of seconds of no activity before closing session
# Defaults to 300

# Maximum number of connections from a single host (IP address).

# Maximum number of bytes/second to be transferred over the data
# connection for each client. MaxTransferRate limits downloads and
# MaxUploadRate uploads. CacheDlRate is the rate for downloads of files

#
# MaxTransferRate 4096
# CacheDlRate 8192

# Access control lists:
# The format is: "ACL Allow|Deny SRC - DST [PORTS]"

# SRC and DST may be in the form x.x.x.x, x.x.x.x/yy, x.x.x.x/y.y.y.y,
# a dns name, or * to match everything.
#
# PORTS is a list of ports. If specified then the rule will only match
# if the destination port of the connection is in this list. This is
# likely only relevant if you are allowing non-transparent proxying of
# ftp connections (ie. DoNTP is enabled above). Specifying * is equivalent 
# to not specifying anything - all ports will be matched
#
# Any connection that matches no rules will be denied. Since there are
# no rules by default you'll need to add something to let any
# connections happen at all (look at the last example if you are
# feeling lazy/not bothered by security).
#
# # Examples:
# # Allow local network to ftp to port 21 only, and block host ftp.evil
# ACL Deny * - ftp.evil            
# ACL Allow 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0 - * 21
#
# # Allow local network to ftp anywhere except certain dodgy ports. Network 
# # admin's machine can ftp anywhere.
# ACL Allow admin.localnet - *
# ACL Deny * - * 1-20,22-1024,6000-6007,7100
# ACL Allow 192.168.0.0/16 - * *
#
# # You don't really believe in this security stuff, and just want
# # everything to work. 
ACL Allow * - *
