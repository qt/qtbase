Qt is supplied with a number of example applications and demonstrations that
have been written to provide developers with examples of the Qt API in use,
highlight good programming practice, and showcase features found in each of
Qt's core technologies.

The example and demo launcher can be used to explore the different categories
available. It provides an overview of each example, lets you view the
documentation in Qt Assistant, and is able to launch examples and demos.

Documentation for examples can be found in the Tutorials and Examples section
of the Qt documentation.
