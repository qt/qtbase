    \brief Accelerated 2D/3D graphics API abstraction.

    The Qt Rendering Hardware Interface is an abstraction for hardware accelerated
    graphics APIs, such as, \l{https://www.khronos.org/opengl/}{OpenGL},
    \l{https://www.khronos.org/opengles/}{OpenGL ES},
    \l{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3d}{Direct3D},
    \l{https://developer.apple.com/metal/}{Metal}, and
    \l{https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/}{Vulkan}.

    \warning The QRhi family of classes in the Qt Gui module, including QShader
    and QShaderDescription, offer limited compatibility guarantees. There are
    no source or binary compatibility guarantees for these classes, meaning the
    API is only guaranteed to work with the Qt version the application was
    developed against. Source incompatible changes are however aimed to be kept
    at a minimum and will only be made in minor releases (6.7, 6.8, and so on).
    To use these classes in an application, link to
    \c{Qt::GuiPrivate} (if using CMake), and include the headers with the \c
    rhi prefix, for example \c{#include <rhi/qrhi.h>}.

    Each QRhi instance is backed by a backend for a specific graphics API. The
    selection of the backend is a run time choice and is up to the application
    or library that creates the QRhi instance. Some backends are available on
    multiple platforms (OpenGL, Vulkan, Null), while APIs specific to a given
    platform are only available when running on the platform in question (Metal
    on macOS/iOS, Direct3D on Windows).

    The available backends currently are:

    \list

    \li OpenGL 2.1 / OpenGL ES 2.0 or newer. Some extensions and newer core
    specification features are utilized when present, for example to enable
    multisample framebuffers or compute shaders. Operating in core profile
    contexts is supported as well. If necessary, applications can query the
    \l{QRhi::Feature}{feature flags} at runtime to check for features that are
    not supported in the OpenGL context backing the QRhi. The OpenGL backend
    builds on QOpenGLContext, QOpenGLFunctions, and the related cross-platform
    infrastructure of the Qt GUI module.

    \li Direct3D 11.1 or newer, with Shader Model 5.0 or newer. When the D3D
    runtime has no support for 11.1 features or Shader Model 5.0,
    initialization using an accelerated graphics device will fail, but using
    the
    \l{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3darticles/directx-warp}{software
    adapter} is still an option.

    \li Direct3D 12.0 or newer, with Shader Model 5.0 or newer. The D3D12
    device is by default created with specifying a minimum feature level of
    \c{D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0}.

    \li Metal 1.2 or newer.

    \li Vulkan 1.0 or newer, optionally utilizing some Vulkan 1.1 level
    features.

    \li Null, a "dummy" backend that issues no graphics calls at all.

    \endlist

    In order to allow shader code to be written once in Qt applications and
    libraries, all shaders are expected to be written in a single language
    which is then compiled into SPIR-V. Versions for various shading language
    are then generated from that, together with reflection information (inputs,
    outputs, shader resources). This is then packed into easily and efficiently
    serializable QShader instances. The compilers and tools to generate such
    shaders are not part of QRhi and the Qt GUI module, but the core classes
    for using such shaders, QShader and QShaderDescription, are. The APIs and
    tools for performing compilation and translation are part of the Qt Shader
    Tools module.

    See the \l{RHI Window Example} for an introductory example of creating a
    portable, cross-platform application that performs accelerated 3D rendering
    onto a QWindow using QRhi.

    \section1 An Impression of the API

    To provide a quick look at the API with a short yet complete example that
    does not involve window-related setup, the following is a complete,
    runnable cross-platform application that renders 20 frames off-screen, and
    then saves the generated images to files after reading back the texture
    contents from the GPU. For an example that renders on-screen, which then
    involves setting up a QWindow and a swapchain, refer to the
    \l{RHI Window Example}.

    For brevity, the initialization of the QRhi is done based on the platform:
    the sample code here chooses Direct 3D 12 on Windows, Metal on macOS and
    iOS, and Vulkan otherwise. OpenGL and Direct 3D 11 are never used by this
    application, but support for those could be introduced with a few
    additional lines.

    \snippet rhioffscreen/main.cpp 0

    The result of the application is 20 \c PNG images (frame0.png -
    frame19.png). These contain a rotating triangle with varying opacity over a
    green background.

    The vertex and fragment shaders are expected to be processed and packaged
    into \c{.qsb} files. The Vulkan-compatible GLSL source code is the
    following:

    \e color.vert
    \snippet rhioffscreen/color.vert 0

    \e color.frag
    \snippet rhioffscreen/color.frag 0

    To manually compile and transpile these shaders to a number of targets
    (SPIR-V, HLSL, MSL, GLSL) and generate the \c{.qsb} files the application
    loads at run time, run \c{qsb --qt6 color.vert -o color.vert.qsb} and
    \c{qsb --qt6 color.frag -o color.frag.qsb}. Alternatively, the Qt Shader
    Tools module offers build system integration for CMake, the
    \c qt_add_shaders() CMake function, that can achieve the same at build time.

    \section1 Design Fundamentals

    A QRhi cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, use the create()
    function. Delete the QRhi instance normally to release the graphics device.

    \section2 Resources

    Instances of classes deriving from QRhiResource, such as, QRhiBuffer,
    QRhiTexture, etc., encapsulate zero, one, or more native graphics
    resources. Instances of such classes are always created via the \c new
    functions of the QRhi, such as, newBuffer(), newTexture(),
    newTextureRenderTarget(), newSwapChain().

    \code
        QRhiBuffer *vbuf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Immutable, QRhiBuffer::VertexBuffer, sizeof(vertexData));
        if (!vbuf->create()) { error(); }
        // ...
        delete vbuf;
    \endcode

    \list

    \li The returned value from functions like newBuffer() is always owned by
    the caller.

    \li Just creating an instance of a QRhiResource subclass never allocates or
    initializes any native resources. That is only done when calling the
    \c create() function of a subclass, for example, QRhiBuffer::create() or
    QRhiTexture::create().

    \li The exceptions are
    QRhiTextureRenderTarget::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor(),
    QRhiSwapChain::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor(), and
    QRhiRenderPassDescriptor::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor(). There is no
    \c create() operation for these and the returned object is immediately
    active.

    \li The resource objects themselves are treated as immutable: once a
    resource has create() called, changing any parameters via the setters, such as,
    QRhiTexture::setPixelSize(), has no effect, unless the underlying native
    resource is released and \c create() is called again. See more about resource
    reuse in the sections below.

    \li The underlying native resources are scheduled for releasing by the
    QRhiResource destructor, or by calling QRhiResource::destroy(). Backends
    often queue release requests and defer executing them to an unspecified
    time, this is hidden from the applications. This way applications do not
    have to worry about releasing native resources that may still be in use by
    an in-flight frame.

    \li Note that this does not mean that a QRhiResource can freely be
    destroy()'ed or deleted within a frame (that is, in a
    \l{QRhi::beginFrame()}{beginFrame()} - \l{QRhi::endFrame()}{endFrame()}
    section). As a general rule, all referenced QRhiResource objects must stay
    unchanged until the frame is submitted by calling
    \l{QRhi::endFrame()}{endFrame()}. To ease this,
    QRhiResource::deleteLater() is provided as a convenience.

    \endlist

    \section2 Command buffers and deferred command execution

    Regardless of the design and capabilities of the underlying graphics API,
    all QRhi backends implement some level of command buffers. No
    QRhiCommandBuffer function issues any native bind or draw command (such as,
    \c glDrawElements) directly. Commands are always recorded in a queue,
    either native or provided by the QRhi backend. The command buffer is
    submitted, and so execution starts only upon QRhi::endFrame() or
    QRhi::finish().

    The deferred nature has consequences for some types of objects. For example,
    writing to a dynamic buffer multiple times within a frame, in case such
    buffers are backed by host-visible memory, will result in making the
    results of all writes are visible to all draw calls in the command buffer
    of the frame, regardless of when the dynamic buffer update was recorded
    relative to a draw call.

    Furthermore, instances of QRhiResource subclasses must be treated immutable
    within a frame in which they are referenced in any way. Create
    all resources upfront, before starting to record commands for the next
    frame. Reusing a QRhiResource instance within a frame (by calling \c create()
    then referencing it again in the same \c{beginFrame - endFrame} section)
    should be avoided as it may lead to unexpected results, depending on the
    backend.

    As a general rule, all referenced QRhiResource objects must stay valid and
    unmodified until the frame is submitted by calling
    \l{QRhi::endFrame()}{endFrame()}. On the other hand, calling
    \l{QRhiResource::destroy()}{destroy()} or deleting the QRhiResource are
    always safe once the frame is submitted, regardless of the status of the
    underlying native resources (which may still be in use by the GPU - but
    that is taken care of internally).

    Unlike APIs like OpenGL, upload and copy type of commands cannot be mixed
    with draw commands. The typical renderer will involve a sequence similar to
    the following:

    \list
    \li (re)create resources
    \li begin frame
    \li record/issue uploads and copies
    \li start recording a render pass
    \li record draw calls
    \li end render pass
    \li end frame
    \endlist

    Recording copy type of operations happens via QRhiResourceUpdateBatch. Such
    operations are committed typically on
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::beginPass()}{beginPass()}.

    When working with legacy rendering engines designed for OpenGL, the
    migration to QRhi often involves redesigning from having a single \c render
    step (that performs copies and uploads, clears buffers, and issues draw
    calls, all mixed together) to a clearly separated, two phase \c prepare -
    \c render setup where the \c render step only starts a renderpass and
    records draw calls, while all resource creation and queuing of updates,
    uploads and copies happens beforehand, in the \c prepare step.

    QRhi does not at the moment allow freely creating and submitting command
    buffers. This may be lifted in the future to some extent, in particular if
    compute support is introduced, but the model of well defined
    \c{frame-start} and \c{frame-end} points, combined with a dedicated,
    "frame" command buffer, where \c{frame-end} implies presenting, is going to
    remain the primary way of operating since this is what fits Qt's various UI
    technologies best.

    \section2 Threading

    A QRhi instance and the associated resources can be created and used on any
    thread but all usage must be limited to that one single thread. When
    rendering to multiple QWindows in an application, having a dedicated thread
    and QRhi instance for each window is often advisable, as this can eliminate
    issues with unexpected throttling caused by presenting to multiple windows.
    Conceptually that is then the same as how Qt Quick scene graph's threaded
    render loop operates when working directly with OpenGL: one thread for each
    window, one QOpenGLContext for each thread. When moving onto QRhi,
    QOpenGLContext is replaced by QRhi, making the migration straightforward.

    When it comes to externally created native objects, such as OpenGL contexts
    passed in via QRhiGles2NativeHandles, it is up to the application to ensure
    they are not misused by other threads.

    Resources are not shareable between QRhi instances. This is an intentional
    choice since QRhi hides most queue, command buffer, and resource
    synchronization related tasks, and provides no API for them. Safe and
    efficient concurrent use of graphics resources from multiple threads is
    tied to those concepts, however, and is thus a topic that is currently out
    of scope, but may be introduced in the future.

    \note The Metal backend requires that an autorelease pool is available on
    the rendering thread, ideally wrapping each iteration of the render loop.
    This needs no action from the users of QRhi when rendering on the main
    (gui) thread, but becomes important when a separate, dedicated render
    thread is used.

    \section2 Resource synchronization

    QRhi does not expose APIs for resource barriers or image layout
    transitions. Such synchronization is done implicitly by the backends, where
    applicable (for example, Vulkan), by tracking resource usage as necessary.
    Buffer and image barriers are inserted before render or compute passes
    transparently to the application.

    \note Resources within a render or compute pass are expected to be bound to
    a single usage during that pass. For example, a buffer can be used as
    vertex, index, uniform, or storage buffer, but not a combination of them
    within a single pass. However, it is perfectly fine to use a buffer as a
    storage buffer in a compute pass, and then as a vertex buffer in a render
    pass, for example, assuming the buffer declared both usages upon creation.

    \note Textures have this rule relaxed in certain cases, because using two
    subresources (typically two different mip levels) of the same texture for
    different access (one for load, one for store) is supported even within the
    same pass.

    \section2 Resource reuse

    From the user's point of view a QRhiResource is reusable immediately after
    calling QRhiResource::destroy(). With the exception of swapchains, calling
    \c create() on an already created object does an implicit \c destroy(). This
    provides a handy shortcut to reuse a QRhiResource instance with different
    parameters, with a new native graphics object underneath.

    The importance of reusing the same object lies in the fact that some
    objects reference other objects: for example, a QRhiShaderResourceBindings
    can reference QRhiBuffer, QRhiTexture, and QRhiSampler instances. If in a
    later frame one of these buffers need to be resized or a sampler parameter
    needs changing, destroying and creating a whole new QRhiBuffer or
    QRhiSampler would invalidate all references to the old instance. By just
    changing the appropriate parameters via QRhiBuffer::setSize() or similar
    and then calling QRhiBuffer::create(), everything works as expected and
    there is no need to touch the QRhiShaderResourceBindings at all, even
    though there is a good chance that under the hood the QRhiBuffer is now
    backed by a whole new native buffer.

    \code
        QRhiBuffer *ubuf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Dynamic, QRhiBuffer::UniformBuffer, 256);
        ubuf->create();

        QRhiShaderResourceBindings *srb = rhi->newShaderResourceBindings()
        srb->setBindings({
            QRhiShaderResourceBinding::uniformBuffer(0, QRhiShaderResourceBinding::VertexStage | QRhiShaderResourceBinding::FragmentStage, ubuf)
        });
        srb->create();

        // ...

        // now in a later frame we need to grow the buffer to a larger size
        ubuf->setSize(512);
        ubuf->create(); // same as ubuf->destroy(); ubuf->create();

        // srb needs no changes whatsoever, any references in it to ubuf
        // stay valid. When it comes to internal details, such as that
        // ubuf may now be backed by a completely different native buffer
        // resource, that is is recognized and handled automatically by the
        // next setShaderResources().
    \endcode

    QRhiTextureRenderTarget offers the same contract: calling
    QRhiCommandBuffer::beginPass() is safe even when one of the render target's
    associated textures or renderbuffers has been rebuilt (by calling \c
    create() on it) since the creation of the render target object. This allows
    the application to resize a texture by setting a new pixel size on the
    QRhiTexture and calling create(), thus creating a whole new native texture
    resource underneath, without having to update the QRhiTextureRenderTarget
    as that will be done implicitly in beginPass().

    \section2 Pooled objects

    In addition to resources, there are pooled objects as well, such as,
    QRhiResourceUpdateBatch. An instance is retrieved via a \c next function,
    such as, nextResourceUpdateBatch(). The caller does not own the returned
    instance in this case. The only valid way of operating here is calling
    functions on the QRhiResourceUpdateBatch and then passing it to
    QRhiCommandBuffer::beginPass() or QRhiCommandBuffer::endPass(). These
    functions take care of returning the batch to the pool. Alternatively, a
    batch can be "canceled" and returned to the pool without processing by
    calling QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::release().

    A typical pattern is thus:

    \code
        QRhiResourceUpdateBatch *resUpdates = rhi->nextResourceUpdateBatch();
        // ...
        resUpdates->updateDynamicBuffer(ubuf, 0, 64, mvp.constData());
        if (!image.isNull()) {
            resUpdates->uploadTexture(texture, image);
            image = QImage();
        }
        // ...
        QRhiCommandBuffer *cb = m_sc->currentFrameCommandBuffer();
        // note the last argument
        cb->beginPass(swapchain->currentFrameRenderTarget(), clearCol, clearDs, resUpdates);
    \endcode

    \section2 Swapchain specifics

    QRhiSwapChain features some special semantics due to the peculiar nature of
    swapchains.

    \list

    \li It has no \c create() but rather a QRhiSwapChain::createOrResize().
    Repeatedly calling this function is \b not the same as calling
    QRhiSwapChain::destroy() followed by QRhiSwapChain::createOrResize(). This
    is because swapchains often have ways to handle the case where buffers need
    to be resized in a manner that is more efficient than a brute force
    destroying and recreating from scratch.

    \li An active QRhiSwapChain must be released by calling
    \l{QRhiSwapChain::destroy()}{destroy()}, or by destroying the object, before
    the QWindow's underlying QPlatformWindow, and so the associated native
    window object, is destroyed. It should not be postponed because releasing
    the swapchain may become problematic (and with some APIs, like Vulkan, is
    explicitly disallowed) when the native window is not around anymore, for
    example because the QPlatformWindow got destroyed upon getting a
    QWindow::close(). Therefore, releasing the swapchain must happen whenever
    the targeted QWindow sends the
    QPlatformSurfaceEvent::SurfaceAboutToBeDestroyed event. If the event does
    not arrive before the destruction of the QWindow - this can happen when
    using QCoreApplication::quit() -, then check QWindow::handle() after the
    event loop exits and invoke the swapchain release when non-null (meaning
    the underlying native window is still around).

    \endlist

    \section2 Ownership

    The general rule is no ownership transfer. Creating a QRhi with an already
    existing graphics device does not mean the QRhi takes ownership of the
    device object. Similarly, ownership is not given away when a device or
    texture object is "exported" via QRhi::nativeHandles() or
    QRhiTexture::nativeTexture(). Most importantly, passing pointers in structs
    and via setters does not transfer ownership.

    \section1 Troubleshooting and Profiling

    \section2 Error reporting

    Functions such as \l QRhi::create() and the resource classes' \c create()
    member functions (e.g., \l QRhiBuffer::create()) indicate failure with the
    return value (\nullptr or
    \c false, respectively). When working with QShader, \l QShader::fromSerialized()
    returns an invalid QShader (for which \l{QShader::isValid()}{isValid()} returns
    \c false) when the data passed to the function cannot be successfully deserialized.
    Some functions, beginFrame() in particular, may also sometimes report "soft failures",
    such as \l FrameOpSwapChainOutOfDate, which do not indicate an unrecoverable error,
    but rather should be seen as a "try again later" response.

    Warnings and errors may get printed at any time to the debug output via
    qWarning(). It is therefore always advisable to inspect the output of the
    application.

    Additional debug messages can be enabled via the following logging
    categories. Messages from these categories are not printed by default
    unless explicitly enabled via QLoggingCategory or the \c QT_LOGGING_RULES
    environment variable. For better interoperation with Qt Quick, the
    environment variable \c{QSG_INFO} also enables these debug prints.

    \list
    \li \c{qt.rhi.general}
    \endlist

    Additionally, applications can query the \l{QRhi::backendName()}{QRhi
    backend name} and
    \l{QRhi::driverInfo()}{graphics device information} from a successfully
    initialized QRhi. This can then be printed to the user or stored in the
    application logs even in production builds, if desired.

    \section2 Investigating rendering problems

    When the rendering results are not as expected, or the application is
    experiencing problems, always consider checking with the the native 3D
    APIs' debug and validation facilities. QRhi itself features limited error
    checking since replicating the already existing, vast amount of
    functionality in the underlying layers is not reasonable.

    \list

    \li For Vulkan, controlling the
    \l{https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-ValidationLayers}{Vulkan
    Validation Layers} is not in the scope of the QRhi, but rather can be
    achieved by configuring the \l QVulkanInstance with the appropriate layers.
    For example, call \c{instance.setLayers({ "VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation" });}
    before invoking \l{QVulkanInstance::create()}{create()} on the QVulkanInstance.
    (note that this assumes that the validation layers are actually installed
    and available, e.g. from the Vulkan SDK) By default, QVulkanInstance conveniently
    redirects the Vulkan debug messages to qDebug, meaning the validation messages get
    printed just like other Qt warnings.

    \li With Direct 3D 11 and 12, a graphics device with the debug layer
    enabled can be requested by toggling the \c enableDebugLayer flag in the
    appropriate \l{QRhiD3D11InitParams}{init params struct}. The messages appear on the
    debug output, which is visible in Qt Creator's messages panel or via a tool
    such as \l{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview}{DebugView}.

    \li For Metal, controlling Metal Validation is outside of QRhi's scope.
    Rather, to enable validation, run the application with the environment
    variable \c{METAL_DEVICE_WRAPPER_TYPE=1} set, or run the application within
    XCode. There may also be further settings and environment variable in modern
    XCode and macOS versions. See for instance
    \l{https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/diagnosing_metal_programming_issues_early}{this
    page}.

    \endlist

    \section2 Frame captures and performance profiling

    A Qt application rendering with QRhi to a window while relying on a 3D API
    under the hood, is, from the windowing and graphics pipeline perspective at
    least, no different from any other (non-Qt) applications using the same 3D
    API. This means that tools and practices for debugging and profiling
    applications involving 3D graphics, such as games, all apply to such a Qt
    application as well.

    A few examples of tools that can provide insights into the rendering
    internals of Qt applications that use QRhi, which includes Qt Quick and Qt
    Quick 3D based projects as well:

    \list

    \li \l{https://renderdoc.org/}{RenderDoc} allows taking frame captures and
    introspecting the recorded commands and pipeline state on Windows and Linux
    for applications using OpenGL, Vulkan, D3D11, or D3D12. When trying to
    figure out why some parts of the 3D scene do not show up as expected,
    RenderDoc is often a fast and efficient way to check the pipeline stages
    and the related state and discover the missing or incorrect value. It is
    also a tool that is actively used when developing Qt itself.

    \li For NVIDIA-based systems,
    \l{https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-graphics}{Nsight Graphics} provides
    a graphics debugger tool on Windows and Linux. In addition to investigating the commands
    in the frame and the pipeline, the vendor-specific tools allow looking at timings and
    hardware performance information, which is not something simple frame captures can provide.

    \li For AMD-based systems, the \l{https://gpuopen.com/rgp/}{Radeon GPU
    Profiler} can be used to gain deeper insights into the application's
    rendering and its performance.

    \li As QRhi supports Direct 3D 12, using
    \l{https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/download/}{PIX}, a performance tuning
    and debugging tool for DirectX 12 games on Windows is an option as well.

    \li On macOS,
    \l{https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/debugging_tools/viewing_your_gpu_workload_with_the_metal_debugger}{the
    XCode Metal debugger} can be used to take and introspect frame
    captures, to investigate performance details, and debug shaders. In macOS 13 it is also possible
    to enable an overlay that displays frame rate and other information for any Metal-based window by
    setting the environment variable \c{MTL_HUD_ENABLED=1}.

    \endlist

    On mobile and embedded platforms, there may be vendor and platform-specific
    tools, provided by the GPU or SoC vendor, available to perform performance
    profiling of application using OpenGL ES or Vulkan.

    When capturing frames, remember that objects and groups of commands can be
    named via debug markers, as long as \l{QRhi::EnableDebugMarkers}{debug
    markers were enabled} for the QRhi, and the graphics API in use supports
    this. To annotate the command stream, call
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::debugMarkBegin()}{debugMarkBegin()},
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::debugMarkEnd()}{debugMarkEnd()} and/or
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::debugMarkMsg()}{debugMarkMsg()}.
    This can be particularly useful in larger frames with multiple render passes.
    Resources are named by calling \l{QRhiResource::setName()}{setName()} before create().

    To perform basic timing measurements on the CPU and GPU side within the
    application, \l QElapsedTimer and
    \l QRhiCommandBuffer::lastCompletedGpuTime() can be used. The latter is
    only available with select graphics APIs at the moment and requires opting
    in via the \l QRhi::EnableTimestamps flag.

    \section2 Resource leak checking

    When destroying a QRhi object without properly destroying all buffers,
    textures, and other resources created from it, warnings about this are
    printed to the debug output whenever the application is a debug build, or
    when the \c QT_RHI_LEAK_CHECK environment variable is set to a non-zero
    value. This is a simple way to discover design issues around resource
    handling within the application rendering logic. Note however that some
    platforms and underlying graphics APIs may perform their own allocation and
    resource leak detection as well, over which Qt will have no direct control.
    For example, when using Vulkan, the memory allocator may raise failing
    assertions in debug builds when resources that own graphics memory
    allocations are not destroyed before the QRhi. In addition, the Vulkan
    validation layer, when enabled, will issue warnings about native graphics
    resources that were not released. Similarly, with Direct 3D warnings may
    get printed about unreleased COM objects when the application does not
    destroy the QRhi and its resources in the correct order.

/*!
    \enum QRhi::Flag
    Describes what special features to enable.

    \value EnableDebugMarkers Enables debug marker groups. Without this frame
    debugging features like making debug groups and custom resource name
    visible in external GPU debugging tools will not be available and functions
    like QRhiCommandBuffer::debugMarkBegin() will become no-ops. Avoid enabling
    in production builds as it may involve a small performance impact. Has no
    effect when the QRhi::DebugMarkers feature is not reported as supported.

    \value EnableTimestamps Enables GPU timestamp collection. When not set,
    QRhiCommandBuffer::lastCompletedGpuTime() always returns 0. Enable this
    only when needed since there may be a small amount of extra work involved
    (e.g. timestamp queries), depending on the underlying graphics API. Has no
    effect when the QRhi::Timestamps feature is not reported as supported.

    \value PreferSoftwareRenderer Indicates that backends should prefer
    choosing an adapter or physical device that renders in software on the CPU.
    For example, with Direct3D there is typically a "Basic Render Driver"
    adapter available with \c{DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG_SOFTWARE}. Setting this flag
    requests the backend to choose that adapter over any other, as long as no
    specific adapter was forced by other backend-specific means. With Vulkan
    this maps to preferring physical devices with
    \c{VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU}. When not available, or when it is not
    possible to decide if an adapter/device is software-based, this flag is
    ignored. It may also be ignored with graphics APIs that have no concept and
    means of enumerating adapters/devices.

    \value EnablePipelineCacheDataSave Enables retrieving the pipeline cache
    contents, where applicable. When not set, pipelineCacheData() will return
    an empty blob always. With backends where retrieving and restoring the
    pipeline cache contents is not supported, the flag has no effect and the
    serialized cache data is always empty. The flag provides an opt-in
    mechanism because the cost of maintaining the related data structures is
    not insignificant with some backends. With Vulkan this feature maps
    directly to VkPipelineCache, vkGetPipelineCacheData and
    VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo::pInitialData. With Direct3D 11 there is no real
    pipline cache, but the results of HLSL->DXBC compilations are stored and
    can be serialized/deserialized via this mechanism. This allows skipping the
    time consuming D3DCompile() in future runs of the applications for shaders
    that come with HLSL source instead of offline pre-compiled bytecode. This
    can provide a huge boost in startup and load times, if there is a lot of
    HLSL source compilation happening. With OpenGL the "pipeline cache" is
    simulated by retrieving and loading shader program binaries (if supported
    by the driver). With OpenGL there are additional, disk-based caching
    mechanisms for shader/program binaries provided by Qt. Writing to those may
    get disabled whenever this flag is set since storing program binaries to
    multiple caches is not sensible.

    \enum QRhi::FrameOpResult
    Describes the result of operations that can have a soft failure.

    \value FrameOpSuccess Success

    \value FrameOpError Unspecified error

    \value FrameOpSwapChainOutOfDate The swapchain is in an inconsistent state
    internally. This can be recoverable by attempting to repeat the operation
    (such as, beginFrame()) later.

    \value FrameOpDeviceLost The graphics device was lost. This can be
    recoverable by attempting to repeat the operation (such as, beginFrame())
    after releasing and reinitializing all objects backed by native graphics
    resources. See isDeviceLost().
 */

/*!
    \enum QRhi::Feature
    Flag values to indicate what features are supported by the backend currently in use.

    \value MultisampleTexture Indicates that textures with a sample count larger
    than 1 are supported. In practice this feature will be unsupported with
    OpenGL ES versions older than 3.1, and OpenGL older than 3.0.

    \value MultisampleRenderBuffer Indicates that renderbuffers with a sample
    count larger than 1 are supported. In practice this feature will be
    unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0, and may also be unsupported with OpenGL 2.x
    unless the relevant extensions are present.

    \value DebugMarkers Indicates that debug marker groups (and so
    QRhiCommandBuffer::debugMarkBegin()) are supported.

    \value Timestamps Indicates that command buffer timestamps are supported.
    Relevant for QRhiCommandBuffer::lastCompletedGpuTime(). Can be expected to
    be supported on Metal, Vulkan, and Direct 3D, assuming the underlying
    implementation supports timestamp queries or similar.

    \value Instancing Indicates that instanced drawing is supported. In
    practice this feature will be unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenGL
    3.2 or older.

    \value CustomInstanceStepRate Indicates that instance step rates other
    than 1 are supported. In practice this feature will always be unsupported
    with OpenGL. In addition, running with Vulkan 1.0 without
    VK_EXT_vertex_attribute_divisor will also lead to reporting false for this
    feature.

    \value PrimitiveRestart Indicates that restarting the assembly of
    primitives when encountering an index value of 0xFFFF
    (\l{QRhiCommandBuffer::IndexUInt16}{IndexUInt16}) or 0xFFFFFFFF
    (\l{QRhiCommandBuffer::IndexUInt32}{IndexUInt32}) is enabled, for certain
    primitive topologies at least. QRhi will try to enable this with all
    backends, but in some cases it will not be supported. Dynamically
    controlling primitive restart is not possible since with some APIs
    primitive restart with a fixed index is always on. Applications must assume
    that whenever this feature is reported as supported, the above mentioned
    index values \c may be treated specially, depending on the topology. The
    only two topologies where primitive restart is guaranteed to behave
    identically across backends, as long as this feature is reported as
    supported, are \l{QRhiGraphicsPipeline::LineStrip}{LineStrip} and
    \l{QRhiGraphicsPipeline::TriangleStrip}{TriangleStrip}.

    \value NonDynamicUniformBuffers Indicates that creating buffers with the
    usage \l{QRhiBuffer::UniformBuffer}{UniformBuffer} and the types
    \l{QRhiBuffer::Immutable}{Immutable} or \l{QRhiBuffer::Static}{Static} is
    supported. When reported as unsupported, uniform (constant) buffers must be
    created as \l{QRhiBuffer::Dynamic}{Dynamic}. (which is recommended
    regardless)

    \value NonFourAlignedEffectiveIndexBufferOffset Indicates that effective
    index buffer offsets (\c{indexOffset + firstIndex * indexComponentSize})
    that are not 4 byte aligned are supported. When not supported, attempting
    to issue a \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::drawIndexed()}{drawIndexed()} with a
    non-aligned effective offset may lead to unspecified behavior. Relevant in
    particular for Metal, where this will be reported as unsupported.

    \value NPOTTextureRepeat Indicates that the
    \l{QRhiSampler::Repeat}{Repeat} wrap mode and mipmap filtering modes are
    supported for textures with a non-power-of-two size. In practice this can
    only be false with OpenGL ES 2.0 implementations without
    \c{GL_OES_texture_npot}.

    \value RedOrAlpha8IsRed Indicates that the
    \l{QRhiTexture::RED_OR_ALPHA8}{RED_OR_ALPHA8} format maps to a one
    component 8-bit \c red format. This is the case for all backends except
    OpenGL when using either OpenGL ES or a non-core profile context. There
    \c{GL_ALPHA}, a one component 8-bit \c alpha format, is used
    instead. Using the special texture format allows having a single code
    path for creating textures, leaving it up to the backend to decide the
    actual format, while the feature flag can be used to pick the
    appropriate shader variant for sampling the texture.

    \value ElementIndexUint Indicates that 32-bit unsigned integer elements are
    supported in the index buffer. In practice this is true everywhere except
    when running on plain OpenGL ES 2.0 implementations without the necessary
    extension. When false, only 16-bit unsigned elements are supported in the
    index buffer.

    \value Compute Indicates that compute shaders, image load/store, and
    storage buffers are supported. OpenGL older than 4.3 and OpenGL ES older
    than 3.1 have no compute support.

    \value WideLines Indicates that lines with a width other than 1 are
    supported. When reported as not supported, the line width set on the
    graphics pipeline state is ignored. This can always be false with some
    backends (D3D11, D3D12, Metal). With Vulkan, the value depends on the
    implementation. With OpenGL, wide lines are not supported in core profile
    contexts.

    \value VertexShaderPointSize Indicates that the size of rasterized points
    set via \c{gl_PointSize} in the vertex shader is taken into account. When
    reported as not supported, drawing points with a size other than 1 is not
    supported. Setting \c{gl_PointSize} in the shader is still valid then, but
    is ignored. (for example, when generating HLSL, the assignment is silently
    dropped from the generated code) Note that some APIs (Metal, Vulkan)
    require the point size to be set in the shader explicitly whenever drawing
    points, even when the size is 1, as they do not automatically default to 1.

    \value BaseVertex Indicates that
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::drawIndexed()}{drawIndexed()} supports the \c
    vertexOffset argument. When reported as not supported, the vertexOffset
    value in an indexed draw is ignored. In practice this feature will be
    unsupported with OpenGL and OpenGL ES versions lower than 3.2, and with
    Metal on older iOS devices, including the iOS Simulator.

    \value BaseInstance Indicates that instanced draw commands support the \c
    firstInstance argument. When reported as not supported, the firstInstance
    value is ignored and the instance ID starts from 0. In practice this feature
    will be unsupported with OpenGL, and with Metal on older iOS devices,
    including the iOS Simulator.

    \value TriangleFanTopology Indicates that QRhiGraphicsPipeline::setTopology()
    supports QRhiGraphicsPipeline::TriangleFan. In practice this feature will be
    unsupported with Metal and Direct 3D 11/12.

    \value ReadBackNonUniformBuffer Indicates that
    \l{QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::readBackBuffer()}{reading buffer contents} is
    supported for QRhiBuffer instances with a usage different than
    UniformBuffer. In practice this feature will be unsupported with OpenGL ES
    2.0.

    \value ReadBackNonBaseMipLevel Indicates that specifying a mip level other
    than 0 is supported when reading back texture contents. When not supported,
    specifying a non-zero level in QRhiReadbackDescription leads to returning
    an all-zero image. In practice this feature will be unsupported with OpenGL
    ES 2.0.

    \value TexelFetch Indicates that texelFetch() and textureLod() are available
    in shaders. In practice this will be reported as unsupported with OpenGL ES
    2.0 and OpenGL 2.x contexts, because GLSL 100 es and versions before 130 do
    not support these functions.

    \value RenderToNonBaseMipLevel Indicates that specifying a mip level other
    than 0 is supported when creating a QRhiTextureRenderTarget with a
    QRhiTexture as its color attachment. When not supported, create() will fail
    whenever the target mip level is not zero. In practice this feature will be
    unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0.

    \value IntAttributes Indicates that specifying input attributes with
    signed and unsigned integer types for a shader pipeline is supported. When
    not supported, build() will succeed but just show a warning message and the
    values of the target attributes will be broken. In practice this feature
    will be unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenGL 2.x.

    \value ScreenSpaceDerivatives Indicates that functions such as dFdx(),
    dFdy(), and fwidth() are supported in shaders. In practice this feature will
    be unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0 without the GL_OES_standard_derivatives
    extension.

    \value ReadBackAnyTextureFormat Indicates that reading back texture
    contents can be expected to work for any QRhiTexture::Format. Backends
    other than OpenGL can be expected to return true for this feature. When
    reported as false, which will typically happen with OpenGL, only the
    formats QRhiTexture::RGBA8 and QRhiTexture::BGRA8 are guaranteed to be
    supported for readbacks. In addition, with OpenGL, but not OpenGL ES,
    reading back the 1 byte per component formats QRhiTexture::R8 and
    QRhiTexture::RED_OR_ALPHA8 are supported as well. Reading back floating
    point formats QRhiTexture::RGBA16F and RGBA32F may work too with OpenGL, as
    long as the implementation provides support for these, but QRhi can give no
    guarantees, as indicated by this flag.

    \value PipelineCacheDataLoadSave Indicates that the pipelineCacheData() and
    setPipelineCacheData() functions are functional. When not supported, the
    functions will not perform any action, the retrieved blob is always empty,
    and thus no benefits can be expected from retrieving and, during a
    subsequent run of the application, reloading the pipeline cache content.

    \value ImageDataStride Indicates that specifying a custom stride (row
    length) for raw image data in texture uploads is supported. When not
    supported (which can happen when the underlying API is OpenGL ES 2.0 without
    support for GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH),
    QRhiTextureSubresourceUploadDescription::setDataStride() must not be used.

    \value RenderBufferImport Indicates that QRhiRenderBuffer::createFrom() is
    supported. For most graphics APIs this is not sensible because
    QRhiRenderBuffer encapsulates texture objects internally, just like
    QRhiTexture. With OpenGL however, renderbuffer object exist as a separate
    object type in the API, and in certain environments (for example, where one
    may want to associated a renderbuffer object with an EGLImage object) it is
    important to allow wrapping an existing OpenGL renderbuffer object with a
    QRhiRenderBuffer.

    \value ThreeDimensionalTextures Indicates that 3D textures are supported.
    In practice this feature will be unsupported with OpenGL and OpenGL ES
    versions lower than 3.0.

    \value RenderTo3DTextureSlice Indicates that rendering to a slice in a 3D
    texture is supported. This can be unsupported with Vulkan 1.0 due to
    relying on VK_IMAGE_CREATE_2D_ARRAY_COMPATIBLE_BIT which is a Vulkan 1.1
    feature.

    \value TextureArrays Indicates that texture arrays are supported and
    QRhi::newTextureArray() is functional. Note that even when texture arrays
    are not supported, arrays of textures are still available as those are two
    independent features.

    \value Tessellation Indicates that the tessellation control and evaluation
    stages are supported. When reported as supported, the topology of a
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline can be set to
    \l{QRhiGraphicsPipeline::Patches}{Patches}, the number of control points
    can be set via
    \l{QRhiGraphicsPipeline::setPatchControlPointCount()}{setPatchControlPointCount()},
    and shaders for tessellation control and evaluation can be specified in the
    QRhiShaderStage list. Tessellation shaders have portability issues between
    APIs (for example, translating GLSL/SPIR-V to HLSL is problematic due to
    the way hull shaders are structured, whereas Metal uses a somewhat
    different tessellation pipeline than others), and therefore unexpected
    issues may still arise, even though basic functionality is implemented
    across all the underlying APIs. For Direct 3D in particular, handwritten
    HLSL hull and domain shaders must be injected into each QShader for the
    tessellation control and evaluation stages, respectively, since qsb cannot
    generate these from SPIR-V. Note that isoline tessellation should be
    avoided as it will not be supported by all backends. The maximum patch
    control point count portable between backends is 32.

    \value GeometryShader Indicates that the geometry shader stage is
    supported. When supported, a geometry shader can be specified in the
    QRhiShaderStage list. Geometry Shaders are considered an experimental
    feature in QRhi and can only be expected to be supported with Vulkan,
    Direct 3D, OpenGL (3.2+) and OpenGL ES (3.2+), assuming the implementation
    reports it as supported at run time. Geometry shaders have portability
    issues between APIs, and therefore no guarantees can be given for a
    universal solution. They will never be supported with Metal. Whereas with
    Direct 3D a handwritten HLSL geometry shader must be injected into each
    QShader for the geometry stage since qsb cannot generate this from SPIR-V.

    \value TextureArrayRange Indicates that for
    \l{QRhi::newTextureArray()}{texture arrays} it is possible to specify a
    range that is exposed to the shaders. Normally all array layers are exposed
    and it is up to the shader to select the layer (via the third coordinate
    passed to texture() when sampling the \c sampler2DArray). When supported,
    calling QRhiTexture::setArrayRangeStart() and
    QRhiTexture::setArrayRangeLength() before
    \l{QRhiTexture::create()}{building} or
    \l{QRhiTexture::createFrom()}{importing} the native texture has an effect,
    and leads to selecting only the specified range from the array. This will
    be necessary in special cases, such as when working with accelerated video
    decoding and Direct 3D 11, because a texture array with both
    \c{D3D11_BIND_DECODER} and \c{D3D11_BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE} on it is only
    usable as a shader resource if a single array layer is selected. Note that
    all this is applicable only when the texture is used as a
    QRhiShaderResourceBinding::SampledTexture or
    QRhiShaderResourceBinding::Texture shader resource, and is not compatible
    with image load/store. This feature is only available with some backends as
    it does not map well to all graphics APIs, and it is only meant to provide
    support for special cases anyhow. In practice the feature can be expected to
    be supported with Direct3D 11/12 and Vulkan.

    \value NonFillPolygonMode Indicates that setting a PolygonMode other than
    the default Fill is supported for QRhiGraphicsPipeline. A common use case
    for changing the mode to Line is to get wireframe rendering. This however
    is not available as a core OpenGL ES feature, and is optional with Vulkan
    as well as some mobile GPUs may not offer the feature.

    \value OneDimensionalTextures Indicates that 1D textures are supported.
    In practice this feature will be unsupported on OpenGL ES.

    \value OneDimensionalTextureMipmaps Indicates that generating 1D texture
    mipmaps are supported. In practice this feature will be unsupported on
    backends that do not report support for
    \l{OneDimensionalTextures}, Metal, and Direct 3D 12.

    \value HalfAttributes Indicates that specifying input attributes with half
    precision (16bit) floating point types for a shader pipeline is supported.
    When not supported, build() will succeed but just show a warning message
    and the values of the target attributes will be broken. In practice this
    feature will be unsupported in some OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenGL 2.x
    implementations. Note that while Direct3D 11/12 does support half precision
    input attributes, it does not support the half3 type. The D3D backends pass
    half3 attributes as half4. To ensure cross platform compatibility, half3
    inputs should be padded to 8 bytes.

    \value RenderToOneDimensionalTexture Indicates that 1D texture render
    targets are supported. In practice this feature will be unsupported on
    backends that do not report support for
    \l{OneDimensionalTextures}, and Metal.

    \value ThreeDimensionalTextureMipmaps Indicates that generating 3D texture
    mipmaps are supported. In practice this feature will be unsupported with
    Direct 3D 12.

    multiple frames with all having this flag set is not recommended (except,

    behave differently when it comes to waiting for command completion without
    presenting so the results are not comparable between them)
 */

/*!
    \enum QRhi::ResourceLimit
    Describes the resource limit to query.

    \value TextureSizeMin Minimum texture width and height. This is typically
    1. The minimum texture size is handled gracefully, meaning attempting to
    create a texture with an empty size will instead create a texture with the
    minimum size.

    \value TextureSizeMax Maximum texture width and height. This depends on the
    graphics API and sometimes the platform or implementation as well.
    Typically the value is in the range 4096 - 16384. Attempting to create
    textures larger than this is expected to fail.

    \value MaxColorAttachments The maximum number of color attachments for a
    QRhiTextureRenderTarget, in case multiple render targets are supported. When
    MRT is not supported, the value is 1. Otherwise this is typically 8, but
    watch out for the fact that OpenGL only mandates 4 as the minimum, and that
    is what some OpenGL ES implementations provide.

    \value FramesInFlight The number of frames the backend may keep "in
    flight": with backends like Vulkan or Metal, it is the responsibility of
    QRhi to block whenever starting a new frame and finding the CPU is already
    \c{N - 1} frames ahead of the GPU (because the command buffer submitted in
    frame no. \c{current} - \c{N} has not yet completed). The value N is what
    is returned from here, and is typically 2. This can be relevant to
    applications that integrate rendering done directly with the graphics API,
    as such rendering code may want to perform double (if the value is 2)
    buffering for resources, such as, buffers, similarly to the QRhi backends
    themselves. The current frame slot index (a value running 0, 1, .., N-1,
    then wrapping around) is retrievable from QRhi::currentFrameSlot(). The
    value is 1 for backends where the graphics API offers no such low level
    control over the command submission process. Note that pipelining may still
    happen even when this value is 1 (some backends, such as D3D11, are
    designed to attempt to enable this, for instance, by using an update
    strategy for uniform buffers that does not stall the pipeline), but that is
    then not controlled by QRhi and so not reflected here in the API.

    \value MaxAsyncReadbackFrames The number of \l{QRhi::endFrame()}{submitted}
    frames (including the one that contains the readback) after which an
    asynchronous texture or buffer readback is guaranteed to complete upon
    \l{QRhi::beginFrame()}{starting a new frame}.

    \value MaxThreadGroupsPerDimension The maximum number of compute
    work/thread groups that can be dispatched. Effectively the maximum value
    for the arguments of QRhiCommandBuffer::dispatch(). Typically 65535.

    \value MaxThreadsPerThreadGroup The maximum number of invocations in a
    single local work group, or in other terminology, the maximum number of
    threads in a thread group. Effectively the maximum value for the product of
    \c local_size_x, \c local_size_y, and \c local_size_z in the compute
    shader. Typical values are 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 1536. Watch out that
    both OpenGL ES and Vulkan specify only 128 as the minimum required limit
    for implementations. While uncommon for Vulkan, some OpenGL ES 3.1
    implementations for mobile/embedded devices only support the spec-mandated
    minimum value.

    \value MaxThreadGroupX The maximum size of a work/thread group in the X
    dimension. Effectively the maximum value of \c local_size_x in the compute
    shader. Typically 256 or 1024.

    \value MaxThreadGroupY The maximum size of a work/thread group in the Y
    dimension. Effectively the maximum value of \c local_size_y in the compute
    shader. Typically 256 or 1024.

    \value MaxThreadGroupZ The maximum size of a work/thread group in the Z
    dimension. Effectively the maximum value of \c local_size_z in the compute
    shader. Typically 64 or 256.

    \value TextureArraySizeMax Maximum texture array size. Typically in range
    256 - 2048. Attempting to \l{QRhi::newTextureArray()}{create a texture
    array} with more elements will likely fail.

    \value MaxUniformBufferRange The number of bytes that can be exposed from a
    uniform buffer to the shaders at once. On OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0
    implementations this may be as low as 3584 bytes (224 four component, 32
    bits per component vectors). Elsewhere the value is typically 16384 (1024
    vec4s) or 65536 (4096 vec4s).

    \value MaxVertexInputs The number of input attributes to the vertex shader.
    The location in a QRhiVertexInputAttribute must be in range \c{[0,
    MaxVertexInputs-1]}. The value may be as low as 8 with OpenGL ES 2.0.
    Elsewhere, typical values are 16, 31, or 32.

    \value MaxVertexOutputs The maximum number of outputs (4 component vector
    \c out variables) from the vertex shader. The value may be as low as 8 with
    OpenGL ES 2.0, and 15 with OpenGL ES 3.0 and some Metal devices. Elsewhere,
    a typical value is 32.

    \class QRhiVertexInputBinding
    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Describes a vertex input binding.

    Specifies the stride (in bytes, must be a multiple of 4), the
    classification and optionally the instance step rate.

    As an example, assume a vertex shader with the following inputs:

    \badcode
        layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
        layout(location = 1) in vec2 texcoord;
    \endcode

    Now let's assume also that 3 component vertex positions \c{(x, y, z)} and 2
    component texture coordinates \c{(u, v)} are provided in a non-interleaved
    format in a buffer (or separate buffers even). Defining two bindings
    could then be done like this:

    \code
        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({
            { 3 * sizeof(float) },
            { 2 * sizeof(float) }
        });
    \endcode

    Only the stride is interesting here since instancing is not used. The
    binding number is given by the index of the QRhiVertexInputBinding
    element in the bindings vector of the QRhiVertexInputLayout.

    Once a graphics pipeline with this vertex input layout is bound, the vertex
    inputs could be set up like the following for drawing a cube with 36
    vertices, assuming we have a single buffer with first the positions and
    then the texture coordinates:

    \code
        const QRhiCommandBuffer::VertexInput vbufBindings[] = {
            { cubeBuf, 0 },
            { cubeBuf, 36 * 3 * sizeof(float) }
        };
        cb->setVertexInput(0, 2, vbufBindings);
    \endcode

    Note how the index defined by \c {startBinding + i}, where \c i is the
    index in the second argument of
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::setVertexInput()}{setVertexInput()}, matches the
    index of the corresponding entry in the \c bindings vector of the
    QRhiVertexInputLayout.

    \note the stride must always be a multiple of 4.

    \class QRhiVertexInputAttribute
    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Describes a single vertex input element.

    The members specify the binding number, location, format, and offset for a
    single vertex input element.

    \note For HLSL it is assumed that the vertex shader translated from SPIR-V
    uses
    \c{TEXCOORD<location>} as the semantic for each input. Hence no separate
    semantic name and index.

    As an example, assume a vertex shader with the following inputs:

    \badcode
        layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
        layout(location = 1) in vec2 texcoord;
    \endcode

    Now let's assume that we have 3 component vertex positions \c{(x, y, z)}
    and 2 component texture coordinates \c{(u, v)} are provided in a
    non-interleaved format in a buffer (or separate buffers even). Once two
    bindings are defined, the attributes could be specified as:

    \code
        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({
            { 3 * sizeof(float) },
            { 2 * sizeof(float) }
        });
        inputLayout.setAttributes({
            { 0, 0, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float3, 0 },
            { 1, 1, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float2, 0 }
        });
    \endcode

    Once a graphics pipeline with this vertex input layout is bound, the vertex
    inputs could be set up like the following for drawing a cube with 36
    vertices, assuming we have a single buffer with first the positions and
    then the texture coordinates:

    \code
        const QRhiCommandBuffer::VertexInput vbufBindings[] = {
            { cubeBuf, 0 },
            { cubeBuf, 36 * 3 * sizeof(float) }
        };
        cb->setVertexInput(0, 2, vbufBindings);
    \endcode

    When working with interleaved data, there will typically be just one
    binding, with multiple attributes referring to that same buffer binding
    point:

    \code
        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({
            { 5 * sizeof(float) }
        });
        inputLayout.setAttributes({
            { 0, 0, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float3, 0 },
            { 0, 1, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float2, 3 * sizeof(float) }
        });
    \endcode

    and then:

    \code
        const QRhiCommandBuffer::VertexInput vbufBinding(interleavedCubeBuf, 0);
        cb->setVertexInput(0, 1, &vbufBinding);
    \endcode

    for details.

    \class QRhiColorAttachment
    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Describes the a single color attachment of a render target.

    A color attachment is either a QRhiTexture or a QRhiRenderBuffer. The
    former, i.e. when texture() is set, is used in most cases.
    QRhiColorAttachment is commonly used in combination with
    QRhiTextureRenderTargetDescription.

    \note texture() and renderBuffer() cannot be both set (be non-null at the
    same time).

    Setting renderBuffer instead is recommended only when multisampling is
    needed. Relying on QRhi::MultisampleRenderBuffer is a better choice than
    QRhi::MultisampleTexture in practice since the former is available in more
    run time configurations (e.g. when running on OpenGL ES 3.0 which has no
    support for multisample textures, but does support multisample
    renderbuffers).

    When targeting a non-multisample texture, the layer() and level() indicate
    the targeted layer (face index \c{0-5} for cubemaps) and mip level. For 3D
    textures layer() specifies the slice (one 2D image within the 3D texture)
    to render to. For texture arrays layer() is the array index.

    When texture() or renderBuffer() is multisample, resolveTexture() can be
    set optionally. When set, samples are resolved automatically into that
    (non-multisample) texture at the end of the render pass. When rendering
    into a multisample renderbuffers, this is the only way to get resolved,
    non-multisample content out of them. Multisample textures allow sampling in
    shaders so for them this is just one option.

    \note when resolving is enabled, the multisample data may not be written
    out at all. This means that the multisample texture() must not be used
    afterwards with shaders for sampling when resolveTexture() is set.

    \note This is a RHI API with limited compatibility guarantees, see \l QRhi

    \class QRhiTextureRenderTargetDescription
    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Describes the color and depth or depth/stencil attachments of a render target.

    A texture render target has zero or more textures as color attachments,
    zero or one renderbuffer as combined depth/stencil buffer or zero or one
    texture as depth buffer.

    \note depthStencilBuffer() and depthTexture() cannot be both set (cannot be
    non-null at the same time).

    Let's look at some example usages in combination with
    QRhiTextureRenderTarget.

    Due to the constructors, the targeting a texture (and no depth/stencil
    buffer) is simple:

    \code
        QRhiTexture *texture = rhi->newTexture(QRhiTexture::RGBA8, QSize(256, 256), 1, QRhiTexture::RenderTarget);
        texture->create();
        QRhiTextureRenderTarget *rt = rhi->newTextureRenderTarget({ texture }));
    \endcode

    The following creates a texture render target that is set up to target mip
    level #2 of a texture:

    \code
        QRhiTexture *texture = rhi->newTexture(QRhiTexture::RGBA8, QSize(512, 512), 1, QRhiTexture::RenderTarget | QRhiTexture::MipMapped);
        texture->create();
        QRhiColorAttachment colorAtt(texture);
        colorAtt.setLevel(2);
        QRhiTextureRenderTarget *rt = rhi->newTextureRenderTarget({ colorAtt });
    \endcode

    Another example, this time to render into a depth texture:

    \code
        QRhiTexture *shadowMap = rhi->newTexture(QRhiTexture::D32F, QSize(1024, 1024), 1, QRhiTexture::RenderTarget);
        shadowMap->create();
        QRhiTextureRenderTargetDescription rtDesc;
        rtDesc.setDepthTexture(shadowMap);
        QRhiTextureRenderTarget *rt = rhi->newTextureRenderTarget(rtDesc);
    \endcode

    A very common case, having a texture as the color attachment and a
    renderbuffer as depth/stencil to enable depth testing:

    \code
        QRhiTexture *texture = rhi->newTexture(QRhiTexture::RGBA8, QSize(512, 512), 1. QRhiTexture::RenderTarget);
        texture->create();
        QRhiRenderBuffer *depthStencil = rhi->newRenderBuffer(QRhiRenderBuffer::DepthStencil, QSize(512, 512));
        depthStencil->create();
        QRhiTextureRenderTargetDescription rtDesc({ texture }, depthStencil);
        QRhiTextureRenderTarget *rt = rhi->newTextureRenderTarget(rtDesc);
    \endcode

    Finally, to enable multisample rendering in a portable manner (so also
    supporting OpenGL ES 3.0), using a QRhiRenderBuffer as the (multisample)
    color buffer and then resolving into a regular (non-multisample) 2D
    texture. To enable depth testing, a depth-stencil buffer, which also must
    use the same sample count, is used as well:

    \code
        QRhiRenderBuffer *colorBuffer = rhi->newRenderBuffer(QRhiRenderBuffer::Color, QSize(512, 512), 4); // 4x MSAA
        colorBuffer->create();
        QRhiRenderBuffer *depthStencil = rhi->newRenderBuffer(QRhiRenderBuffer::DepthStencil, QSize(512, 512), 4);
        depthStencil->create();
        QRhiTexture *texture = rhi->newTexture(QRhiTexture::RGBA8, QSize(512, 512), 1, QRhiTexture::RenderTarget);
        texture->create();
        QRhiColorAttachment colorAtt(colorBuffer);
        colorAtt.setResolveTexture(texture);
        QRhiTextureRenderTarget *rt = rhi->newTextureRenderTarget({ colorAtt, depthStencil });
    \endcode

    \class QRhiTextureSubresourceUploadDescription
    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Describes the source for one mip level in a layer in a texture upload operation.

    The source content is specified either as a QImage or as a raw blob. The
    former is only allowed for uncompressed textures with a format that can be
    mapped to QImage, while the latter is supported for all formats, including
    floating point and compressed.

    \note image() and data() cannot be both set at the same time.

    destinationTopLeft() specifies the top-left corner of the target
    rectangle. Defaults to (0, 0).

    An empty sourceSize() (the default) indicates that size is assumed to be
    the size of the subresource. With QImage-based uploads this implies that
    the size of the source image() must match the subresource. When providing
    raw data instead, sufficient number of bytes must be provided in data().

    sourceTopLeft() is supported only for QImage-based uploads, and specifies
    the top-left corner of the source rectangle.

    \note Setting sourceSize() or sourceTopLeft() may trigger a QImage copy
    internally, depending on the format and the backend.

    When providing raw data, and the stride is not specified via
    setDataStride(), the stride (row pitch, row length in bytes) of the
    provided data must be equal to \c{width * pixelSize} where \c pixelSize is
    the number of bytes used for one pixel, and there must be no additional
    padding between rows. There is no row start alignment requirement.

    When there is unused data at the end of each row in the input raw data,
    call setDataStride() with the total number of bytes per row. The stride
    must always be a multiple of the number of bytes for one pixel. The row
    stride is only applicable to image data for textures with an uncompressed
    format.

    \note The format of the source data must be compatible with the texture
    format. With many graphics APIs the data is copied as-is into a staging
    buffer, there is no intermediate format conversion provided by QRhi. This
    applies to floating point formats as well, with, for example, RGBA16F
    requiring half floats in the source data.

    \note Setting the stride via setDataStride() is only functional when
    QRhi::ImageDataStride is reported as
    \l{QRhi::isFeatureSupported()}{supported}. In practice this can be expected
    to be supported everywhere except for OpenGL ES 2.0.

    \note When a QImage is given, the stride returned from
    QImage::bytesPerLine() is taken into account automatically.

    \warning When a QImage is given and the QImage does not own the underlying
    pixel data, it is up to the caller to ensure that the associated data stays
    valid until the end of the frame. (just submitting the resource update batch
    is not sufficient, the data must stay valid until QRhi::endFrame() is called
    in order to be portable across all backends) If this cannot be ensured, the
    caller is strongly encouraged to call QImage::detach() on the image before
    passing it to uploadTexture().

    \note This is a RHI API with limited compatibility guarantees, see \l QRhi
    for details.

    \class QRhiTextureUploadDescription
    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Describes a texture upload operation.

    Used with QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::uploadTexture(). That function has two
    variants: one taking a QImage and one taking a
    QRhiTextureUploadDescription. The former is a convenience version,
    internally creating a QRhiTextureUploadDescription with a single image
    targeting level 0 for layer 0.

    An example of the the common, simple case of wanting to upload the contents
    of a QImage to a QRhiTexture with a matching pixel size:

    \code
        QImage image(256, 256, QImage::Format_RGBA8888);
        image.fill(Qt::green); // or could use a QPainter targeting image
        QRhiTexture *texture = rhi->newTexture(QRhiTexture::RGBA8, QSize(256, 256));
        texture->create();
        QRhiResourceUpdateBatch *u = rhi->nextResourceUpdateBatch();
        u->uploadTexture(texture, image);
    \endcode

    When cubemaps, pre-generated mip images, compressed textures, or partial
    uploads are involved, applications will have to use this class instead.

    QRhiTextureUploadDescription also enables specifying batched uploads, which
    are useful for example when generating an atlas or glyph cache texture:
    multiple, partial uploads for the same subresource (meaning the same layer
    and level) are supported, and can be, depending on the backend and the
    underlying graphics API, more efficient when batched into the same
    QRhiTextureUploadDescription as opposed to issuing individual
    \l{QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::uploadTexture()}{uploadTexture()} commands for
    each of them.

    \note Cubemaps have one layer for each of the six faces in the order +X,
    -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z.

    For example, specifying the faces of a cubemap could look like the following:

    \code
        QImage faces[6];
        // ...
        QVarLengthArray<QRhiTextureUploadEntry, 6> entries;
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i)
          entries.append(QRhiTextureUploadEntry(i, 0, faces[i]));
        QRhiTextureUploadDescription desc;
        desc.setEntries(entries.cbegin(), entries.cend());
        resourceUpdates->uploadTexture(texture, desc);
    \endcode

    Another example that specifies mip images for a compressed texture:

    \code
        QList<QRhiTextureUploadEntry> entries;
        const int mipCount = rhi->mipLevelsForSize(compressedTexture->pixelSize());
        for (int level = 0; level < mipCount; ++level) {
            const QByteArray compressedDataForLevel = ..
            entries.append(QRhiTextureUploadEntry(0, level, compressedDataForLevel));
        }
        QRhiTextureUploadDescription desc;
        desc.setEntries(entries.cbegin(), entries.cend());
        resourceUpdates->uploadTexture(compressedTexture, desc);
    \endcode

    With partial uploads targeting the same subresource, it is recommended to
    batch them into a single upload request, whenever possible:

    \code
      QRhiTextureSubresourceUploadDescription subresDesc(image);
      subresDesc.setSourceSize(QSize(10, 10));
      subResDesc.setDestinationTopLeft(QPoint(50, 40));
      QRhiTextureUploadEntry entry(0, 0, subresDesc); // layer 0, level 0

      QRhiTextureSubresourceUploadDescription subresDesc2(image);
      subresDesc2.setSourceSize(QSize(30, 40));
      subResDesc2.setDestinationTopLeft(QPoint(100, 200));
      QRhiTextureUploadEntry entry2(0, 0, subresDesc2); // layer 0, level 0, i.e. same subresource

      QRhiTextureUploadDescription desc({ entry, entry2});
      resourceUpdates->uploadTexture(texture, desc);
    \endcode

    however the behavior is different: the QRhiResource will not be destroyed
    until the frame is submitted via QRhi::endFrame(), thus satisfying the QRhi
    requirement of not altering QRhiResource objects that are referenced by the
    frame being recorded.

    If the QRhi that created this object is already destroyed, the object is
    deleted immediately.

    Using deleteLater() can be a useful convenience in many cases, and it
    complements the low-level guarantee (that the underlying native graphics
    objects are never destroyed until it is safe to do so and it is known for
    sure that they are not used by the GPU in an still in-flight frame), by
    offering a way to make sure the C++ object instances (of QRhiBuffer,
    QRhiTexture, etc.) themselves also stay valid until the end of the current
    frame.

    The following example shows a convenient way of creating a throwaway buffer
    that is only used in one frame and gets automatically released in
    endFrame(). (when it comes to the underlying native buffer(s), the usual
    guarantee applies: the QRhi backend defers the releasing of those until it
    is guaranteed that the frame in which the buffer is accessed by the GPU has
    completed)

    \code
        rhi->beginFrame(swapchain);
        QRhiBuffer *buf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Immutable, QRhiBuffer::VertexBuffer, 256);
        buf->deleteLater(); // !

    \class QRhiBuffer

    \since 6.6
    \brief Vertex, index, or uniform (constant) buffer resource.

    \note This is a RHI API with limited compatibility guarantees, see \l QRhi
    for details.

    A QRhiBuffer encapsulates zero, one, or more native buffer objects (such as
    a \c VkBuffer or \c MTLBuffer). With some graphics APIs and backends
    certain types of buffers may not use a native buffer object at all (e.g.
    OpenGL if uniform buffer objects are not used), but this is transparent to
    the user of the QRhiBuffer API. Similarly, the fact that some types of
    buffers may use two or three native buffers underneath, in order to allow
    efficient per-frame content update without stalling the GPU pipeline, is
    mostly invisible to the applications and libraries.

    A QRhiBuffer instance is always created by calling
    \l{QRhi::newBuffer()}{the QRhi's newBuffer() function}. This creates no
    native graphics resources. To do that, call create() after setting the
    appropriate options, such as the type, usage flags, size, although in most cases these
    are already set based on the arguments passed to
    \l{QRhi::newBuffer()}{newBuffer()}.

    \section2 Example usage

    To create a uniform buffer for a shader where the GLSL uniform block
    contains a single \c mat4 member, and update the contents:

    \code
        QRhiBuffer *ubuf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Dynamic, QRhiBuffer::UniformBuffer, 64);
        if (!ubuf->create()) { error(); }
        QRhiResourceUpdateBatch *batch = rhi->nextResourceUpdateBatch();
        QMatrix4x4 mvp;
        // ... set up the modelview-projection matrix
        batch->updateDynamicBuffer(ubuf, 0, 64, mvp.constData());
        // ...
        commandBuffer->resourceUpdate(batch); // or, alternatively, pass 'batch' to a beginPass() call
    \endcode

    An example of creating a buffer with vertex data:

    \code
        const float vertices[] = { -1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f, -1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f };
        QRhiBuffer *vbuf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Immutable, QRhiBuffer::VertexBuffer, sizeof(vertices));
        if (!vbuf->create()) { error(); }
        QRhiResourceUpdateBatch *batch = rhi->nextResourceUpdateBatch();
        batch->uploadStaticBuffer(vbuf, vertices);
        // ...
        commandBuffer->resourceUpdate(batch); // or, alternatively, pass 'batch' to a beginPass() call
    \endcode

    An index buffer:

    \code
        static const quint16 indices[] = { 0, 1, 2 };
        QRhiBuffer *ibuf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Immutable, QRhiBuffer::IndexBuffer, sizeof(indices));
        if (!ibuf->create()) { error(); }
        QRhiResourceUpdateBatch *batch = rhi->nextResourceUpdateBatch();
        batch->uploadStaticBuffer(ibuf, indices);
        // ...
        commandBuffer->resourceUpdate(batch); // or, alternatively, pass 'batch' to a beginPass() call
    \endcode

    \section2 Common patterns

    A call to create() destroys any existing native resources if create() was
    successfully called before. If those native resources are still in use by
    an in-flight frame (i.e., there's a chance they are still read by the GPU),
    the destroying of those resources is deferred automatically. Thus a very
    common and convenient pattern to safely increase the size of an already
    initialized buffer is the following. In practice this drops and creates a
    whole new set of native resources underneath, so it is not necessarily a
    cheap operation, but is more convenient and still faster than the
    alternatives, because by not destroying the \c buf object itself, all
    references to it stay valid in other data structures (e.g., in any
    QRhiShaderResourceBinding the QRhiBuffer is referenced from).

    \code
        if (buf->size() < newSize) {
            buf->setSize(newSize);
            if (!buf->create()) { error(); }
        }
        // continue using buf, fill it with new data
    \endcode

    When working with uniform buffers, it will sometimes be necessary to
    combine data for multiple draw calls into a single buffer for efficiency
    reasons. Be aware of the aligment requirements: with some graphics APIs
    offsets for a uniform buffer must be aligned to 256 bytes. This applies
    both to QRhiShaderResourceBinding and to the dynamic offsets passed to
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::setShaderResources()}{setShaderResources()}. Use the
    \l{QRhi::ubufAlignment()}{ubufAlignment()} and
    \l{QRhi::ubufAligned()}{ubufAligned()} functions to create portable code.
    As an example, the following is an outline for issuing multiple (\c N) draw
    calls with the same pipeline and geometry, but with a different data in the
    uniform buffers exposed at binding point 0. This assumes the buffer is
    exposed via
    \l{QRhiShaderResourceBinding::uniformBufferWithDynamicOffset()}{uniformBufferWithDynamicOffset()}
    which allows passing a QRhiCommandBuffer::DynamicOffset list to
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::setShaderResources()}{setShaderResources()}.

    \code
        const int N = 2;
        const int UB_SIZE = 64 + 4; // assuming a uniform block with { mat4 matrix; float opacity; }
        const int ONE_UBUF_SIZE = rhi->ubufAligned(UB_SIZE);
        const int TOTAL_UBUF_SIZE = N * ONE_UBUF_SIZE;
        QRhiBuffer *ubuf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Dynamic, QRhiBuffer::UniformBuffer, TOTAL_UBUF_SIZE);
        if (!ubuf->create()) { error(); }
        QRhiResourceUpdateBatch *batch = rhi->nextResourceUpdateBatch();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            batch->updateDynamicBuffer(ubuf, i * ONE_UBUF_SIZE, 64, matrix.constData());
            updates->updateDynamicBuffer(ubuf, i * ONE_UBUF_SIZE + 64, 4, &opacity);
        }
        // ...
        // beginPass(), set pipeline, etc., and then:
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            QRhiCommandBuffer::DynamicOffset dynOfs[] = { { 0, i * ONE_UBUF_SIZE } };
            cb->setShaderResources(srb, 1, dynOfs);
            cb->draw(36);
        }
    \endcode

    \enum QRhiBuffer::Type

    \value Immutable Indicates that the data is not expected to change ever
    after the initial upload. Under the hood such buffer resources are
    typically placed in device local (GPU) memory (on systems where
    applicable). Uploading new data is possible, but may be expensive. The
    upload typically happens by copying to a separate, host visible staging
    buffer from which a GPU buffer-to-buffer copy is issued into the actual
    GPU-only buffer.

    \value Static Indicates that the data is expected to change only
    infrequently. Typically placed in device local (GPU) memory, where
    applicable. On backends where host visible staging buffers are used for
    uploading, the staging buffers are kept around for this type, unlike with
    Immutable, so subsequent uploads do not suffer in performance. Frequent
    updates, especially updates in consecutive frames, should be avoided.

    \value Dynamic Indicates that the data is expected to change frequently.
    Not recommended for large buffers. Typically backed by host visible memory
    in 2 copies in order to allow for changing without stalling the graphics
    pipeline. The double buffering is managed transparently to the applications

    \brief Texture resource.

    A QRhiTexture encapsulates a native texture object, such as a \c VkImage or
    \c MTLTexture.

    A QRhiTexture instance is always created by calling
    \l{QRhi::newTexture()}{the QRhi's newTexture() function}. This creates no
    native graphics resources. To do that, call create() after setting the
    appropriate options, such as the format and size, although in most cases
    these are already set based on the arguments passed to
    \l{QRhi::newTexture()}{newTexture()}.

    Setting the \l{QRhiTexture::Flags}{flags} correctly is essential, otherwise
    various errors can occur depending on the underlying QRhi backend and
    graphics API. For example, when a texture will be rendered into from a
    render pass via QRhiTextureRenderTarget, the texture must be created with
    the \l RenderTarget flag set. Similarly, when the texture is going to be
    \l{QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::readBackTexture()}{read back}, the \l
    UsedAsTransferSource flag must be set upfront. Mipmapped textures must have
    the MipMapped flag set. And so on. It is not possible to change the flags
    once create() has succeeded. To release the existing and create a new
    native texture object with the changed settings, call the setters and call
    create() again. This then might be a potentially expensive operation.

    \section2 Example usage

    To create a 2D texture with a size of 512x512 pixels and set its contents to all green:

    \code
        QRhiTexture *texture = rhi->newTexture(QRhiTexture::RGBA8, QSize(512, 512));
        if (!texture->create()) { error(); }
        QRhiResourceUpdateBatch *batch = rhi->nextResourceUpdateBatch();
        QImage image(512, 512, QImage::Format_RGBA8888);
        image.fill(Qt::green);
        batch->uploadTexture(texture, image);
        // ...
        commandBuffer->resourceUpdate(batch); // or, alternatively, pass 'batch' to a beginPass() call
    \endcode

    \section2 Common patterns

    A call to create() destroys any existing native resources if create() was
    successfully called before. If those native resources are still in use by
    an in-flight frame (i.e., there's a chance they are still read by the GPU),
    the destroying of those resources is deferred automatically. Thus a very
    common and convenient pattern to safely change the size of an already
    existing texture is the following. In practice this drops and creates a
    whole new native texture resource underneath, so it is not necessarily a
    cheap operation, but is more convenient and still faster than the
    alternatives, because by not destroying the \c texture object itself, all
    references to it stay valid in other data structures (e.g., in any
    QShaderResourceBinding the QRhiTexture is referenced from).

    \code
        // determine newSize, e.g. based on the swapchain's output size or other factors
        if (texture->pixelSize() != newSize) {
            texture->setPixelSize(newSize);
            if (!texture->create()) { error(); }
        }
        // continue using texture, fill it with new data
    \endcode

    \note This is a RHI API with limited compatibility guarantees, see \l QRhi
    for details.

/*!
    \enum QRhiTexture::Flag

    Flag values to specify how the texture is going to be used. Not honoring
    the flags set before create() and attempting to use the texture in ways that
    was not declared upfront can lead to unspecified behavior or decreased
    performance depending on the backend and the underlying graphics API.

    \value RenderTarget The texture going to be used in combination with
    QRhiTextureRenderTarget.

    \value CubeMap The texture is a cubemap. Such textures have 6 layers, one
    for each face in the order of +X, -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z. Cubemap textures
    cannot be multisample.

     \value MipMapped The texture has mipmaps. The appropriate mip count is
     calculated automatically and can also be retrieved via
     QRhi::mipLevelsForSize(). The images for the mip levels have to be
     provided in the texture uploaded or generated via
     QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::generateMips(). Multisample textures cannot have
     mipmaps.

    \value sRGB Use an sRGB format.

    \value UsedAsTransferSource The texture is used as the source of a texture
    copy or readback, meaning the texture is given as the source in
    QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::copyTexture() or
    QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::readBackTexture().

     \value UsedWithGenerateMips The texture is going to be used with
     QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::generateMips().

     \value UsedWithLoadStore The texture is going to be used with image
     load/store operations, for example, in a compute shader.

     \value UsedAsCompressedAtlas The texture has a compressed format and the
     dimensions of subresource uploads may not match the texture size.

     \value ExternalOES The texture should use the GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES
     target with OpenGL. This flag is ignored with other graphics APIs.

     \value ThreeDimensional The texture is a 3D texture. Such textures should
     be created with the QRhi::newTexture() overload taking a depth in addition
     to width and height. A 3D texture can have mipmaps but cannot be
     multisample. When rendering into, or uploading data to a 3D texture, the \c
     layer specified in the render target's color attachment or the upload
     description refers to a single slice in range [0..depth-1]. The underlying
     graphics API may not support 3D textures at run time. Support is indicated
     by the QRhi::ThreeDimensionalTextures feature.

     \value TextureRectangleGL The texture should use the GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE
     target with OpenGL. This flag is ignored with other graphics APIs. Just
     like ExternalOES, this flag is useful when working with platform APIs where
     native OpenGL texture objects received from the platform are wrapped in a
     QRhiTexture, and the platform can only provide textures for a non-2D
     texture target.

     \value TextureArray The texture is a texture array, i.e. a single texture
     object that is a homogeneous array of 2D textures. Texture arrays are
     created with QRhi::newTextureArray(). The underlying graphics API may not
     support texture array objects at run time. Support is indicated by the
     QRhi::TextureArrays feature. When rendering into, or uploading data to a
     texture array, the \c layer specified in the render target's color
     attachment or the upload description selects a single element in the array.

     \value OneDimensional The texture is a 1D texture. Such textures can be
     created by passing a 0 height and depth to QRhi::newTexture(). Note that
     there can be limitations on one dimensional textures depending on the
     underlying graphics API. For example, rendering to them or using them with
     mipmap-based filtering may be unsupported. This is indicated by the
     QRhi::OneDimensionalTextures and QRhi::OneDimensionalTextureMipmaps
     feature flags.

    \value R32F One component, 32-bit float.

    \value RGB10A2 Four components, unsigned normalized 10 bit R, G, and B,
    2-bit alpha. This is a packed format so native endianness applies. Note
    that there is no BGR10A2. This is because RGB10A2 maps to

    \note When importing a 3D texture, or a texture array object, or, with

    The concept of the compatibility of renderpass descriptors is similar to
    the \l{QRhiShaderResourceBindings::isLayoutCompatible}{layout
    compatibility} of QRhiShaderResourceBindings instances. They allow better
    reuse of QRhiGraphicsPipeline instances: for example, a
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline instance cache is expected to use these functions to
    look for a matching pipeline, instead of just comparing pointers, thus
    allowing a different QRhiRenderPassDescriptor and
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings to be used in combination with the pipeline, as
    long as they are compatible.

    The exact details of compatibility depend on the underlying graphics API.
    Two renderpass descriptors
    \l{QRhiTextureRenderTarget::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor()}{created}
    from the same QRhiTextureRenderTarget are always compatible.

    Similarly to QRhiShaderResourceBindings, compatibility can also be tested

    calling serializedFormat() allows testing for compatibility by comparing the
    returned vector to another QRhiRenderPassDescriptor's

    (in order to allow creating new pipelines which in turn requires a
    renderpass descriptor object), and the lifetime of the renderpass
    descriptor created from a render target may be shorter than the pipelines.
    (for example, because the engine manages and destroys renderpasses together

    first color attachment, or the depth/stencil buffer if there are no color
    attachments. If the associated textures or renderbuffers are resized and

    \brief Texture render target resource.

    A texture render target allows rendering into one or more textures,
    optionally with a depth texture or depth/stencil renderbuffer.

    For multisample rendering the common approach is to use a renderbuffer as
    the color attachment and set the non-multisample destination texture as the
    \c{resolve texture}.

    \note Textures used in combination with QRhiTextureRenderTarget must be
    created with the QRhiTexture::RenderTarget flag.

    The simplest example of creating a render target with a texture as its
    single color attachment:

    \code
        QRhiTexture *texture = rhi->newTexture(QRhiTexture::RGBA8, size, 1, QRhiTexture::RenderTarget);
        texture->create();
        QRhiTextureRenderTarget *rt = rhi->newTextureRenderTarget({ texture });
        rp = rt->newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor();
        rt->setRenderPassDescriptor(rt);
        rt->create();
        // rt can now be used with beginPass()

    native resources).

    \value PreserveColorContents Indicates that the contents of the color
    attachments is to be loaded when starting a render pass, instead of
    clearing. This is potentially more expensive, especially on mobile (tiled)
    GPUs, but allows preserving the existing contents between passes.

    \value PreserveDepthStencilContents Indicates that the contents of the

    clearing. Only applicable when a texture is used as the depth buffer
    (QRhiTextureRenderTargetDescription::depthTexture() is set) because

    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Encapsulates resources for making buffer, texture, sampler resources visible to shaders.

    A QRhiShaderResourceBindings is a collection of QRhiShaderResourceBinding
    objects, each of which describe a single binding.

    Take a fragment shader with the following interface:

    \badcode
        layout(std140, binding = 0) uniform buf {
            mat4 mvp;
            int flip;
        } ubuf;

        layout(binding = 1) uniform sampler2D tex;
    \endcode

    To make resources visible to the shader, the following
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings could be created and then passed to
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline::setShaderResourceBindings():

    \code
        QRhiShaderResourceBindings *srb = rhi->newShaderResourceBindings();
        srb->setBindings({
            QRhiShaderResourceBinding::uniformBuffer(0, QRhiShaderResourceBinding::VertexStage | QRhiShaderResourceBinding::FragmentStage, ubuf),
            QRhiShaderResourceBinding::sampledTexture(1, QRhiShaderResourceBinding::FragmentStage, texture, sampler)
        });
        srb->create();
        // ...
        QRhiGraphicsPipeline *ps = rhi->newGraphicsPipeline();
        // ...
        ps->setShaderResourceBindings(srb);
        ps->create();
        // ...
        cb->setGraphicsPipeline(ps);
        cb->setShaderResources(); // binds srb
    \endcode

    This assumes that \c ubuf is a QRhiBuffer, \c texture is a QRhiTexture,
    while \a sampler is a QRhiSampler. The example also assumes that the
    uniform block is present in the vertex shader as well so the same buffer is
    made visible to the vertex stage too.

    \section3 Advanced usage

    Building on the above example, let's assume that a pass now needs to use
    the exact same pipeline and shaders with a different texture. Creating a
    whole separate QRhiGraphicsPipeline just for this would be an overkill.
    This is why QRhiCommandBuffer::setShaderResources() allows specifying a \a
    srb argument. As long as the layouts (so the number of bindings and the
    binding points) match between two QRhiShaderResourceBindings, they can both
    be used with the same pipeline, assuming the pipeline was created with one of
    them in the first place. See isLayoutCompatible() for more details.

    \code
        QRhiShaderResourceBindings *srb2 = rhi->newShaderResourceBindings();
        // ...
        cb->setGraphicsPipeline(ps);
        cb->setShaderResources(srb2); // binds srb2
    \endcode

    a valid texture and sampler for each element of the array.

    \warning All elements of the array must be specified. With the above
    example, the only valid, portable approach is calling this function with a
    \a count of 8. Additionally, all QRhiTexture and QRhiSampler instances must
    be valid, meaning nullptr is not an accepted value. This is due to some of
    the underlying APIs, such as, Vulkan, that require a valid image and
    sampler object for each element in descriptor arrays. Applications are
    advised to provide "dummy" samplers and textures if some array elements are
    not relevant (due to not being accessed in the shader).

    QRhiShaderResourceBindings with unspecified resources, but such an object
    cannot be used with QRhiCommandBuffer::setShaderResources(). It is however
    suitable for creating pipelines. Such a pipeline must then always be used

    \class QRhiGraphicsPipeline
    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Graphics pipeline state resource.

    Represents a graphics pipeline. What exactly this map to in the underlying
    native graphics API, varies. Where there is a concept of pipeline objects,
    for example with Vulkan, the QRhi backend will create such an object upon
    calling create(). Elsewhere, for example with OpenGL, the
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline may merely collect the various state, and create()'s
    main task is to set up the corresponding shader program, but deferring
    looking at any of the requested state to a later point.

    As with all QRhiResource subclasses, the two-phased initialization pattern
    applies: setting any values via the setters, for example setDepthTest(), is
    only effective after calling create(). Avoid changing any values once the
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline has been initialized via create(). To change some
    state, set the new value and call create() again. However, that will
    effectively release all underlying native resources and create new ones. As
    a result, it may be a heavy, expensive operation. Rather, prefer creating
    multiple pipelines with the different states, and
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::setGraphicsPipeline()}{switch between them} when
    recording the render pass.

    \note Setting the shader stages is mandatory. There must be at least one
    stage, and there must be a vertex stage.

    \note Setting the shader resource bindings is mandatory. The referenced
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings must already have create() called on it by the
    time create() is called. Associating with a QRhiShaderResourceBindings that
    has no bindings is also valid, as long as no shader in any stage expects any
    resources. Using a QRhiShaderResourceBindings object that does not specify
    any actual resources (i.e., the buffers, textures, etc. for the binding
    points are set to \nullptr) is valid as well, as long as a
    \l{QRhiShaderResourceBindings::isLayoutCompatible()}{layout-compatible}
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings, that specifies resources for all the bindings,
    is going to be set via
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::setShaderResources()}{setShaderResources()} when
    recording the render pass.

    \note Setting the render pass descriptor is mandatory. To obtain a
    QRhiRenderPassDescriptor that can be passed to setRenderPassDescriptor(),
    use either QRhiTextureRenderTarget::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor() or
    QRhiSwapChain::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor().

    \note Setting the vertex input layout is mandatory.

    \note sampleCount() defaults to 1 and must match the sample count of the
    render target's color and depth stencil attachments.

    \note The depth test, depth write, and stencil test are disabled by
    default. The face culling mode defaults to no culling.

    \note stencilReadMask() and stencilWriteMask() apply to both faces. They
    both default to 0xFF.

    \section2 Example usage

    All settings of a graphics pipeline have defaults which might be suitable
    to many applications. Therefore a minimal example of creating a graphics
    pipeline could be the following. This assumes that the vertex shader takes
    a single \c{vec3 position} input at the input location 0. With the
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings and QRhiRenderPassDescriptor objects, plus the
    QShader collections for the vertex and fragment stages, a pipeline could be
    created like this:

    \code
        QRhiShaderResourceBindings *srb;
        QRhiRenderPassDescriptor *rpDesc;
        QShader vs, fs;
        // ...

        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({ { 3 * sizeof(float) } });
        inputLayout.setAttributes({ { 0, 0, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float3, 0 } });

        QRhiGraphicsPipeline *ps = rhi->newGraphicsPipeline();
        ps->setShaderStages({ { QRhiShaderStage::Vertex, vs }, { QRhiShaderStage::Fragment, fs } });
        ps->setVertexInputLayout(inputLayout);
        ps->setShaderResourceBindings(srb);
        ps->setRenderPassDescriptor(rpDesc);
        if (!ps->create()) { error(); }
    \endcode

    The above code creates a pipeline object that uses the defaults for many
    settings and states. For example, it will use a \l Triangles topology, no
    backface culling, blending is disabled but color write is enabled for all
    four channels, depth test/write are disabled, stencil operations are
    disabled.

    \note This is a RHI API with limited compatibility guarantees, see \l QRhi
    for details.

/*!
    \enum QRhiGraphicsPipeline::Flag

    Flag values for describing the dynamic state of the pipeline, and other
    options. The viewport is always dynamic.

    \value UsesBlendConstants Indicates that a blend color constant will be set
    via QRhiCommandBuffer::setBlendConstants()

    \value UsesStencilRef Indicates that a stencil reference value will be set
    via QRhiCommandBuffer::setStencilRef()

    \value UsesScissor Indicates that a scissor rectangle will be set via
    QRhiCommandBuffer::setScissor()

    \value CompileShadersWithDebugInfo Requests compiling shaders with debug
    information enabled. This is relevant only when runtime shader compilation
    from source code is involved, and only when the underlying infrastructure
    supports this. With concrete examples, this is not relevant with Vulkan and
    SPIR-V, because the GLSL-to-SPIR-V compilation does not happen at run
    time. On the other hand, consider Direct3D and HLSL, where there are
    multiple options: when the QShader packages ship with pre-compiled bytecode
    (\c DXBC), debug information is to be requested through the tool that
    generates the \c{.qsb} file, similarly to the case of Vulkan and
    SPIR-V. However, when having HLSL source code in the pre- or
    runtime-generated QShader packages, the first phase of compilation (HLSL
    source to intermediate format) happens at run time too, with this flag taken
    into account. Debug information is relevant in particular with tools like
    RenderDoc since it allows seeing the original source code when investigating
    the pipeline and when performing vertex or fragment shader debugging.

/*!
    \fn virtual bool QRhiGraphicsPipeline::create() = 0

    Creates the corresponding native graphics resources. If there are already
    resources present due to an earlier create() with no corresponding
    destroy(), then destroy() is called implicitly first.

    \return \c true when successful, \c false when a graphics operation failed.
    Regardless of the return value, calling destroy() is always safe.

    \note This may be, depending on the underlying graphics API, an expensive
    operation, especially when shaders get compiled/optimized from source or
    from an intermediate bytecode format to the GPU's own instruction set.
    Where applicable, the QRhi backend automatically sets up the relevant
    non-persistent facilities to accelerate this, for example the Vulkan
    backend automatically creates a \c VkPipelineCache to improve data reuse
    during the lifetime of the application.

    \note Drivers may also employ various persistent (disk-based) caching
    strategies for shader and pipeline data, which is hidden to and is outside
    of Qt's control. In some cases, depending on the graphics API and the QRhi
    backend, there are facilities within QRhi for manually managing such a
    cache, allowing the retrieval of a serializable blob that can then be
    reloaded in the future runs of the application to ensure faster pipeline
    creation times. See QRhi::pipelineCacheData() and
    QRhi::setPipelineCacheData() for details. Note also that when working with
    a QRhi instance managed by a higher level Qt framework, such as Qt Quick,
    it is possible that such disk-based caching is taken care of automatically,
    for example QQuickWindow uses a disk-based pipeline cache by default (which
    comes in addition to any driver-level caching).

    \class QRhiSwapChain
    \inmodule QtGui
    \since 6.6
    \brief Swapchain resource.

    A swapchain enables presenting rendering results to a surface. A swapchain
    is typically backed by a set of color buffers. Of these, one is displayed
    at a time.

    Below is a typical pattern for creating and managing a swapchain and some
    associated resources in order to render onto a QWindow:

    \code
      void init()
      {
          sc = rhi->newSwapChain();
          ds = rhi->newRenderBuffer(QRhiRenderBuffer::DepthStencil,
                                    QSize(), // no need to set the size here due to UsedWithSwapChainOnly
                                    1,
                                    QRhiRenderBuffer::UsedWithSwapChainOnly);
          sc->setWindow(window);
          sc->setDepthStencil(ds);
          rp = sc->newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor();
          sc->setRenderPassDescriptor(rp);
          resizeSwapChain();
      }

      void resizeSwapChain()
      {
          hasSwapChain = sc->createOrResize();
      }

      void render()
      {
          if (!hasSwapChain || notExposed)
              return;

          if (sc->currentPixelSize() != sc->surfacePixelSize() || newlyExposed) {
              resizeSwapChain();
              if (!hasSwapChain)
                  return;
              newlyExposed = false;
          }

          rhi->beginFrame(sc);
          // ...
          rhi->endFrame(sc);
      }
    \endcode

    Avoid relying on QWindow resize events to resize swapchains, especially
    considering that surface sizes may not always fully match the QWindow
    reported dimensions. The safe, cross-platform approach is to do the check
    via surfacePixelSize() whenever starting a new frame.

    Releasing the swapchain must happen while the QWindow and the underlying
    native window is fully up and running. Building on the previous example:

    \code
        void releaseSwapChain()
        {
            if (hasSwapChain) {
                sc->destroy();
                hasSwapChain = false;
            }
        }

        // assuming Window is our QWindow subclass
        bool Window::event(QEvent *e)
        {
            switch (e->type()) {
            case QEvent::UpdateRequest: // for QWindow::requestUpdate()
                render();
                break;
            case QEvent::PlatformSurface:
                if (static_cast<QPlatformSurfaceEvent *>(e)->surfaceEventType() == QPlatformSurfaceEvent::SurfaceAboutToBeDestroyed)
                    releaseSwapChain();
                break;
            default:
                break;
            }
            return QWindow::event(e);
        }
    \endcode

    Initializing the swapchain and starting to render the first frame cannot
    start at any time. The safe, cross-platform approach is to rely on expose
    events. QExposeEvent is a loosely specified event that is sent whenever a
    window gets mapped, obscured, and resized, depending on the platform.

    \code
        void Window::exposeEvent(QExposeEvent *)
        {
            // initialize and start rendering when the window becomes usable for graphics purposes
            if (isExposed() && !running) {
                running = true;
                init();
            }

            // stop pushing frames when not exposed or size becomes 0
            if ((!isExposed() || (hasSwapChain && sc->surfacePixelSize().isEmpty())) && running)
                notExposed = true;

            // continue when exposed again and the surface has a valid size
            if (isExposed() && running && notExposed && !sc->surfacePixelSize().isEmpty()) {
                notExposed = false;
                newlyExposed = true;
            }

            if (isExposed() && !sc->surfacePixelSize().isEmpty())
                render();
        }
    \endcode

    Once the rendering has started, a simple way to request a new frame is
    QWindow::requestUpdate(). While on some platforms this is merely a small
    timer, on others it has a specific implementation: for instance on macOS or
    iOS it may be backed by
    \l{https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corevideo/cvdisplaylink?language=objc}{CVDisplayLink}.
    The example above is already prepared for update requests by handling
    QEvent::UpdateRequest.

    While acting as a QRhiRenderTarget, QRhiSwapChain also manages a
    QRhiCommandBuffer. Calling QRhi::endFrame() submits the recorded commands
    and also enqueues a \c present request. The default behavior is to do this
    with a swap interval of 1, meaning synchronizing to the display's vertical
    refresh is enabled. Thus the rendering thread calling beginFrame() and
    endFrame() will get throttled to vsync. On some backends this can be
    disabled by passing QRhiSwapChain:NoVSync in flags().

    Multisampling (MSAA) is handled transparently to the applications when
    requested via setSampleCount(). Where applicable, QRhiSwapChain will take
    care of creating additional color buffers and issuing a multisample resolve
    command at the end of a frame. For OpenGL, it is necessary to request the
    appropriate sample count also via QSurfaceFormat, by calling
    QSurfaceFormat::setDefaultFormat() before initializing the QRhi.

    \note This is a RHI API with limited compatibility guarantees, see \l QRhi
    for details.
 */

/*!
    \enum QRhiSwapChain::Flag
    Flag values to describe swapchain properties

    \value SurfaceHasPreMulAlpha Indicates that the target surface has
    transparency with premultiplied alpha. For example, this is what Qt Quick
    uses when the alpha channel is enabled on the target QWindow, because the
    scenegraph rendrerer always outputs fragments with alpha multiplied into
    the red, green, and blue values. To ensure identical behavior across
    platforms, always set QSurfaceFormat::alphaBufferSize() to a non-zero value
    on the target QWindow whenever this flag is set on the swapchain.

    \value SurfaceHasNonPreMulAlpha Indicates the target surface has
    transparency with non-premultiplied alpha. Be aware that this may not be
    supported on some systems, if the system compositor always expects content
    with premultiplied alpha. In that case the behavior with this flag set is
    expected to be equivalent to SurfaceHasPreMulAlpha.

    \value sRGB Requests to pick an sRGB format for the swapchain's color
    buffers and/or render target views, where applicable. Note that this
    implies that sRGB framebuffer update and blending will get enabled for all
    content targeting this swapchain, and opting out is not possible. For
    OpenGL, set \l{QSurfaceFormat::sRGBColorSpace}{sRGBColorSpace} on the
    QSurfaceFormat of the QWindow in addition. Applicable only when the
    swapchain format is set to QRhiSwapChain::SDR.

    \value UsedAsTransferSource Indicates the swapchain will be used as the
    source of a readback in QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::readBackTexture().

    \value NoVSync Requests disabling waiting for vertical sync, also avoiding
    throttling the rendering thread. The behavior is backend specific and
    applicable only where it is possible to control this. Some may ignore the
    request altogether. For OpenGL, try instead setting the swap interval to 0
    on the QWindow via QSurfaceFormat::setSwapInterval().

    \value MinimalBufferCount Requests creating the swapchain with the minimum
    number of buffers, which is in practice 2, unless the graphics
    implementation has a higher minimum number than that. Only applicable with
    backends where such control is available via the graphics API, for example,
    Vulkan. By default it is up to the backend to decide what number of buffers
    it requests (in practice this is almost always either 2 or 3), and it is
    not the applications' concern. However, on Vulkan for instance the backend
    will likely prefer the higher number (3), for example to avoid odd
    performance issues with some Vulkan implementations on mobile devices. It
    could be that on some platforms it can prove to be beneficial to force the
    lower buffer count (2), so this flag allows forcing that. Note that all
    this has no effect on the number of frames kept in flight, so the CPU
    (QRhi) will still prepare frames at most \c{N - 1} frames ahead of the GPU,
    even when the swapchain image buffer count larger than \c N. (\c{N} =
    QRhi::FramesInFlight and typically 2).
 */

/*!
    \enum QRhiSwapChain::Format
    Describes the swapchain format. The default format is SDR.

    This enum is used with
    \l{QRhiSwapChain::isFormatSupported()}{isFormatSupported()} to check
    upfront if creating the swapchain with the given format is supported by the
    platform and the window's associated screen, and with
    \l{QRhiSwapChain::setFormat()}{setFormat()}
    to set the requested format in the swapchain before calling
    \l{QRhiSwapChain::createOrResize()}{createOrResize()} for the first time.

    \value SDR 8-bit RGBA or BGRA, depending on the backend and platform. With
    OpenGL ES in particular, it could happen that the platform provides less
    than 8 bits (e.g. due to EGL and the QSurfaceFormat choosing a 565 or 444
    format - this is outside the control of QRhi). Standard dynamic range. May
    be combined with setting the QRhiSwapChain::sRGB flag.

    \value HDRExtendedSrgbLinear 16-bit float RGBA, high dynamic range,
    extended linear sRGB (scRGB) color space. This involves Rec. 709 primaries
    (same as SDR/sRGB) and linear colors. Conversion to the display's native
    color space (such as, HDR10) is performed by the windowing system. On
    Windows this is the canonical color space of the system compositor, and is
    the recommended format for HDR swapchains in general.

    \value HDR10 10-bit unsigned int RGB or BGR with 2 bit alpha, high dynamic
    range, HDR10 (Rec. 2020) color space with an ST2084 PQ transfer function.

    resized.

    \note Typical rendering logic will call this function to get the output
    size when starting to prepare a new frame, and base dependent calculations
    (such as, the viewport) on the size returned from this function.

    While in many cases the value is the same as \c{QWindow::size() *
    QWindow::devicePixelRatio()}, relying on the QWindow-reported size is not
    guaranteed to be correct on all platforms and graphics API implementations.
    Using this function is therefore strongly recommended whenever there is a
    need to identify the dimensions, in pixels, of the output layer or surface.

    This also has the added benefit of avoiding potential data races when QRhi
    is used on a dedicated rendering thread, because the need to call QWindow
    functions, that may then access data updated on the main thread, is
    avoided.

/*!
    \fn virtual QSize QRhiSwapChain::surfacePixelSize() = 0

    \return The size of the window's associated surface or layer.

    \warning Do not assume this is the same as \c{QWindow::size() *
    QWindow::devicePixelRatio()}. With some graphics APIs and windowing system
    interfaces (for example, Vulkan) there is a theoretical possibility for a
    surface to assume a size different from the associated window. To support
    these cases, \b{rendering logic must always base size-derived calculations
    (such as, viewports) on the size reported from QRhiSwapChain, and never on
    the size queried from QWindow}.

    \note \b{Can also be called before createOrResize(), if at least window() is
    already set. This in combination with currentPixelSize() allows to detect
    when a swapchain needs to be resized.} However, watch out for the fact that
    the size of the underlying native object (surface, layer, or similar) is
    "live", so whenever this function is called, it returns the latest value
    reported by the underlying implementation, without any atomicity guarantee.
    Therefore, using this function to determine pixel sizes for graphics
    resources that are used in a frame is strongly discouraged. Rely on
    currentPixelSize() instead which returns a size that is atomic and will not
    change between createOrResize() invocations.

    \note For depth-stencil buffers used in combination with the swapchain's
    color buffers, it is strongly recommended to rely on the automatic sizing
    and rebuilding behavior provided by the
    QRhiRenderBuffer:UsedWithSwapChainOnly flag. Avoid querying the surface
    size via this function just to get a size that can be passed to
    QRhiRenderBuffer::setPixelSize() as that would suffer from the lack of
    atomicity as described above.

/*!
    \fn virtual bool QRhiSwapChain::isFormatSupported(Format f) = 0

    \return true if the given swapchain format \a f is supported. SDR is always
    supported.

    \note Can be called independently of createOrResize(), but window() must
    already be set. Calling without the window set may lead to unexpected
    results depending on the backend and platform (most likely false for any
    HDR format), because HDR format support is usually tied to the output
    (screen) to which the swapchain's associated window belongs at any given
    time. If the result is true for a HDR format, then creating the swapchain
    with that format is expected to succeed as long as the window is not moved
    to another screen in the meantime.

    The main use of this function is to call it before the first
    createOrResize() after the window is already set. This allow the QRhi
    backends to perform platform or windowing system specific queries to
    determine if the window (and the screen it is on) is capable of true HDR
    output with the specified format.

    When the format is reported as supported, call setFormat() to set the
    requested format and call createOrResize(). Be aware of the consequences
    however: successfully requesting a HDR format will involve having to deal
    with a different color space, possibly doing white level correction for
    non-HDR-aware content, adjusting tonemapping methods, adjusting offscreen

    \brief Describes the high dynamic range related information of the
    swapchain's associated output.

    To perform tonemapping, one often needs to know the maximum luminance of
    the display the swapchain's window is associated with. While this is often
    made user-configurable, it can be highly useful to set defaults based on
    the values reported by the display itself, thus providing a decent starting
    point.

    There are some problems however: the information is exposed in different
    forms on different platforms, whereas with cross-platform graphics APIs
    there is often no associated solution at all, because managing such
    information is not in the scope of the API (and may rather be retrievable
    via other platform-specific means, if any).

    The struct returned from QRhiSwapChain::hdrInfo() contains either some
    hard-coded defaults, indicated by the \c isHardCodedDefaults field, or real
    values received from an API such as DXGI (IDXGIOutput6) or Cocoa
    (NSScreen). The default is 1000 nits for maximum luminance.

    With Metal on macOS/iOS, there is no luminance values exposed in the
    platform APIs. Instead, the maximum color component value, that would be
    1.0 in a non-HDR setup, is provided. The \c limitsType field indicates what
    kind of information is available. It is then up to the clients of QRhi to
    access the correct data from the \c limits union and use it as they see
    fit.

    With an API like Vulkan, where there is no way to get such information, the
    values are always the built-in defaults and \c isHardCodedDefaults is
    always true.

    \note This is a RHI API with limited compatibility guarantees, see \l QRhi
    for details.

    Set to true when the data in the QRhiSwapChainHdrInfo consists entirely of
    the hard-coded default values, for example because there is no way to query
    the relevant information with a given graphics API or platform. (or because
    querying it can be achieved only by means, e.g. platform APIs in some other
    area, that are out of scope for the QRhi layer of the Qt graphics stack to
    handle)

/*!

    Contains the actual values queried from the graphics API or the platform.
    The type of data is indicated by \l limitsType. This is therefore a union.
    There are currently two options:

    Luminance values in nits:

    \code
        struct {
            float minLuminance;
            float maxLuminance;
        } luminanceInNits;
    \endcode

    Whereas for macOS/iOS, the current maximum and potential maximum color
    component values are provided:

    \code
        struct {
            float maxColorComponentValue;
            float maxPotentialColorComponentValue;
        } colorComponentValue;

/*!
    \return the HDR information for the associated display.

    The returned struct is always the default one if createOrResize() has not
    been successfully called yet.

    \note What happens when moving a window with an initialized swapchain
    between displays (HDR to HDR with different characteristics, HDR to SDR,
    etc.) is not currently well-defined and depends heavily on the windowing
    system and compositor, with potentially varying behavior between platforms.
    Currently QRhi only guarantees that hdrInfo() returns valid data, if
    available, for the display to which the swapchain's associated window
    belonged at the time of createOrResize().

   Enqueues a texture-to-host copy operation as described by \a rb.

   Normally \a rb will specify a QRhiTexture as the source. However, when the
   swapchain in the current frame was created with
   QRhiSwapChain::UsedAsTransferSource, it can also be the source of the
   readback. For this, leave the texture set to null in \a rb.

   Unlike other operations, the results here need to be processed by the
   application. Therefore, \a result provides not just the data but also a
   callback as operations on the batch are asynchronous by nature:

   \code
      rhi->beginFrame(swapchain);
      cb->beginPass(swapchain->currentFrameRenderTarget(), colorClear, dsClear);
      // ...
      QRhiReadbackResult *rbResult = new QRhiReadbackResult;

              const uchar *p = reinterpret_cast<const uchar *>(rbResult->data.constData());
              QImage image(p, rbResult->pixelSize.width(), rbResult->pixelSize.height(), fmt);
              image.save("result.png");

      u->readBackTexture(rb, rbResult);
      cb->endPass(u);
      rhi->endFrame(swapchain);
   \endcode

   \note The texture must be created with QRhiTexture::UsedAsTransferSource.

   \note Multisample textures cannot be read back.

   \note The readback returns raw byte data, in order to allow the applications
   to interpret it in any way they see fit. Be aware of the blending settings
   of rendering code: if the blending is set up to rely on premultiplied alpha,
   the results of the readback must also be interpreted as Premultiplied.

   \note When interpreting the resulting raw data, be aware that the readback
   happens with a byte ordered format. A \l{QRhiTexture::RGBA8}{RGBA8} texture
   maps therefore to byte ordered QImage formats, such as,
   QImage::Format_RGBA8888.

   \note The asynchronous readback is guaranteed to have completed when one of
   the following conditions is met: \l{QRhi::finish()}{finish()} has been
   called; or, at least \c N frames have been \l{QRhi::endFrame()}{submitted},
   including the frame that issued the readback operation, and the
   \l{QRhi::beginFrame()}{recording of a new frame} has been started, where \c
   N is the \l{QRhi::resourceLimit()}{resource limit value} returned for
   QRhi::MaxAsyncReadbackFrames.

   A single readback operation copies one mip level of one layer (cubemap face
   or 3D slice or texture array element) at a time. The level and layer are
   specified by the respective fields in \a rb.

/*!
    Records starting a new render pass targeting the render target \a rt.

    \a resourceUpdates, when not null, specifies a resource update batch that
    is to be committed and then released.

    The color and depth/stencil buffers of the render target are normally
    cleared. The clear values are specified in \a colorClearValue and \a
    depthStencilClearValue. The exception is when the render target was created
    with QRhiTextureRenderTarget::PreserveColorContents and/or
    QRhiTextureRenderTarget::PreserveDepthStencilContents. The clear values are
    ignored then.

    \note Enabling preserved color or depth contents leads to decreased
    performance depending on the underlying hardware. Mobile GPUs with tiled
    architecture benefit from not having to reload the previous contents into
    the tile buffer. Similarly, a QRhiTextureRenderTarget with a QRhiTexture as
    the depth buffer is less efficient than a QRhiRenderBuffer since using a
    depth texture triggers requiring writing the data out to it, while with
    renderbuffers this is not needed (as the API does not allow sampling or
    reading from a renderbuffer).

    \note Do not assume that any state or resource bindings persist between
    passes.

    \note The QRhiCommandBuffer's \c set and \c draw functions can only be
    called inside a pass. Also, with the exception of setGraphicsPipeline(),
    they expect to have a pipeline set already on the command buffer.
    Unspecified issues may arise otherwise, depending on the backend.

    If \a rt is a QRhiTextureRenderTarget, beginPass() performs a check to see
    if the texture and renderbuffer objects referenced from the render target
    are up-to-date. This is similar to what setShaderResources() does for
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings. If any of the attachments had been rebuilt
    since QRhiTextureRenderTarget::create(), an implicit call to create() is
    made on \a rt. Therefore, if \a rt has a QRhiTexture color attachment \c
    texture, and one needs to make the texture a different size, the following
    is then valid:
    \code
      QRhiTextureRenderTarget *rt = rhi->newTextureRenderTarget({ { texture } });
      rt->create();
      // ...
      texture->setPixelSize(new_size);
      texture->create();
      cb->beginPass(rt, colorClear, dsClear); // this is ok, no explicit rt->create() is required before
    \endcode

    flag is \c ExternalContents. This should be specified whenever
    beginExternal() will be called within the pass started by this function.

    \a srb can be null in which case the current graphics or compute pipeline's
    associated QRhiShaderResourceBindings is used. When \a srb is non-null, it
    must be
    \l{QRhiShaderResourceBindings::isLayoutCompatible()}{layout-compatible},
    meaning the layout (number of bindings, the type and binding number of each
    binding) must fully match the QRhiShaderResourceBindings that was
    associated with the pipeline at the time of calling the pipeline's create().

    There are cases when a seemingly unnecessary setShaderResources() call is
    mandatory: when rebuilding a resource referenced from \a srb, for example
    changing the size of a QRhiBuffer followed by a QRhiBuffer::create(), this
    is the place where associated native objects (such as descriptor sets in
    case of Vulkan) are updated to refer to the current native resources that
    back the QRhiBuffer, QRhiTexture, QRhiSampler objects referenced from \a
    srb. In this case setShaderResources() must be called even if \a srb is
    the same as in the last call.

    When \a srb is not null, the QRhiShaderResourceBindings object the pipeline
    was built with in create() is guaranteed to be not accessed in any form. In
    fact, it does not need to be valid even at this point: destroying the
    pipeline's associated srb after create() and instead explicitly specifying
    another, \l{QRhiShaderResourceBindings::isLayoutCompatible()}{layout
    compatible} one in every setShaderResources() call is valid.

    \a dynamicOffsets allows specifying buffer offsets for uniform buffers that
    were associated with \a srb via
    QRhiShaderResourceBinding::uniformBufferWithDynamicOffset(). This is
    different from providing the offset in the \a srb itself: dynamic offsets
    do not require building a new QRhiShaderResourceBindings for every
    different offset, can avoid writing the underlying descriptors (with
    backends where applicable), and so they may be more efficient. Each element
    of \a dynamicOffsets is a \c binding - \c offset pair.
    \a dynamicOffsetCount specifies the number of elements in \a dynamicOffsets.

    \note All offsets in \a dynamicOffsets must be byte aligned to the value
    returned from QRhi::ubufAlignment().

    \note Some backends may limit the number of supported dynamic offsets.
    Avoid using a \a dynamicOffsetCount larger than 8.

    \note QRhi will optimize out unnecessary invocations within a pass (taking
    the conditions described above into account), so therefore overoptimizing
    to avoid calls to this function is not necessary on the applications' side.

    Records vertex input bindings.

    The index buffer used by subsequent drawIndexed() commands is specified by
    \a indexBuf, \a indexOffset, and \a indexFormat. \a indexBuf can be set to
    null when indexed drawing is not needed.

    Vertex buffer bindings are batched. \a startBinding specifies the first
    binding number. The recorded command then binds each buffer from \a
    bindings to the binding point \c{startBinding + i} where \c i is the index
    in \a bindings. Each element in \a bindings specifies a QRhiBuffer and an
    offset.

    \note Some backends may limit the number of vertex buffer bindings. Avoid
    using a \a bindingCount larger than 8.

    Superfluous vertex input and index changes in the same pass are ignored
    automatically with most backends and therefore applications do not need to
    overoptimize to avoid calls to this function.

    \note This function can only be called inside a render pass, meaning
    between a beginPass() and endPass() call.

    As a simple example, take a vertex shader with two inputs:

    \badcode
        layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
        layout(location = 1) in vec3 color;
    \endcode

    and assume we have the data available in interleaved format, using only 2
    floats for position (so 5 floats per vertex: x, y, r, g, b). A QRhiGraphicsPipeline for
    this shader can then be created using the input layout:

    \code
        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({
            { 5 * sizeof(float) }

            { 0, 1, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float3, 2 * sizeof(float) }
        });
    \endcode

    Here there is one buffer binding (binding number 0), with two inputs
    referencing it. When recording the pass, once the pipeline is set, the
    vertex bindings can be specified simply like the following, assuming vbuf
    is the QRhiBuffer with all the interleaved position+color data:

    \code
        const QRhiCommandBuffer::VertexInput vbufBinding(vbuf, 0);
        cb->setVertexInput(0, 1, &vbufBinding);

    The loss of the device is typically detected in beginFrame(), endFrame() or

    happens. With some backends QRhiSwapChain::createOrResize() can also fail
    due to a device loss. Therefore this function is provided as a generic way
    to check if a device loss was detected by a previous operation.

    When the device is lost, no further operations should be done via the QRhi.
    Rather, all QRhi resources should be released, followed by destroying the
    QRhi. A new QRhi can then be attempted to be created. If successful, all
    graphics resources must be reinitialized. If not, try again later,
    repeatedly.

    While simple applications may decide to not care about device loss,
    on the commonly used desktop platforms a device loss can happen
    due to a variety of reasons, including physically disconnecting the
    graphics adapter, disabling the device or driver, uninstalling or upgrading
    the graphics driver, or due to errors that lead to a graphics device reset.
    Some of these can happen under perfectly normal circumstances as well, for
    example the upgrade of the graphics driver to a newer version is a common
    task that can happen at any time while a Qt application is running. Users
    may very well expect applications to be able to survive this, even when the
    application is actively using an API like OpenGL or Direct3D.

    Qt's own frameworks built on top of QRhi, such as, Qt Quick, can be
    expected to handle and take appropriate measures when a device loss occurs.
    If the data for graphics resources, such as textures and buffers, are still
    available on the CPU side, such an event may not be noticeable on the
    application level at all since graphics resources can seamlessly be
    reinitialized then. However, applications and libraries working directly
    with QRhi are expected to be prepared to check and handle device loss
    situations themselves.

    \note With OpenGL, applications may need to opt-in to context reset
    notifications by setting QSurfaceFormat::ResetNotification on the
    QOpenGLContext. This is typically done by enabling the flag in
    QRhiGles2InitParams::format. Keep in mind however that some systems may

    Loads \a data into the pipeline cache, when applicable.

    When the PipelineCacheDataLoadSave is reported as unsupported, the function
    is safe to call, but has no effect.

    The blob returned by pipelineCacheData() is always specific to the Qt
    version, the QRhi backend, and, in some cases, also to the graphics device,
    and a given version of the graphics driver. QRhi takes care of adding the
    appropriate header and safeguards that ensure that the data can always be
    passed safely to this function. If there is a mismatch, e.g. because the
    driver has been upgraded to a newer version, or because the data was
    generated from a different QRhi backend, a warning is printed and \a data
    is safely ignored.

    With Vulkan, this maps directly to VkPipelineCache. Calling this function
    creates a new Vulkan pipeline cache object, with its initial data sourced
    from \a data. The pipeline cache object is then used by all subsequently
    created QRhiGraphicsPipeline and QRhiComputePipeline objects, thus
    accelerating, potentially, the pipeline creation.

    With other APIs there is no real pipeline cache, but they may provide a
    cache with bytecode from shader compilations (D3D) or program binaries
    (OpenGL). In applications that perform a lot of shader compilation from
    source at run time this can provide a significant boost in subsequent runs
    if the "pipeline cache" is pre-seeded from an earlier run using this
    function.

    \note QRhi cannot give any guarantees that \a data has an effect on the
    pipeline and shader creation performance. With APIs like Vulkan, it is up
    to the driver to decide if \a data is used for some purpose, or if it is
    ignored.

    See EnablePipelineCacheDataSave for further details about this feature.

    \note This mechanism offered by QRhi is independent of the drivers' own
    internal caching mechanism, if any. This means that, depending on the
    graphics API and its implementation, the exact effects of retrieving and
    then reloading \a data are not predictable. Improved performance may not be
    visible at all in case other caching mechanisms outside of Qt's control are
    already active.

/*!
    Gathers and returns statistics about the timings and allocations of
    graphics resources.

    Data about memory allocations is only available with some backends, where
    such operations are under Qt's control. With graphics APIs where there is
    no lower level control over resource memory allocations, this will never be
    supported and all relevant fields in the results are 0.

    With Vulkan in particular, the values are valid always, and are queried
    from the underlying memory allocator library. This gives an insight into
    the memory requirements of the active buffers and textures.

    The same is true for Direct 3D 12. In addition to the memory allocator
    library's statistics, here the result also includes a \c totalUsageBytes
    field which reports the total size including additional resources that are
    not under the memory allocator library's control (swapchain buffers,
    descriptor heaps, etc.), as reported by DXGI.

    The values correspond to all types of memory used, combined. (i.e. video +
    system in case of a discreet GPU)

    Additional data, such as the total time in milliseconds spent in graphics
    and compute pipeline creation (which usually involves shader compilation or
    cache lookups, and potentially expensive processing) is available with most
    backends.

    \note The elapsed times for operations such as pipeline creation may be
    affected by various factors. The results should not be compared between
    different backends since the concept of "pipelines" and what exactly
    happens under the hood during, for instance, a call to
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline::create(), differ greatly between graphics APIs and
    their implementations.

    \note Additionally, many drivers will likely employ various caching
    strategies for shaders, programs, pipelines. (independently of Qt's own
    similar facilities, such as setPipelineCacheData() or the OpenGL-specific
    program binary disk cache). Because such internal behavior is transparent
    to the API client, Qt and QRhi have no knowledge or control over the exact
    caching strategy, persistency, invalidation of the cached data, etc. When
    reading timings, such as the time spent on pipeline creation, the potential
    presence and unspecified behavior of driver-level caching mechanisms should
    be kept in mind.

    With backends like Vulkan or Metal, it is the responsibility of the QRhi
    backend to block whenever starting a new frame and finding the CPU is
    already \c{FramesInFlight - 1} frames ahead of the GPU (because the command
    buffer submitted in frame no. \c{current} - \c{FramesInFlight} has not yet
    completed).

    Resources that tend to change between frames (such as, the native buffer
    object backing a QRhiBuffer with type QRhiBuffer::Dynamic) exist in
    multiple versions, so that each frame, that can be submitted while a
    previous one is still being processed, works with its own copy, thus
    avoiding the need to stall the pipeline when preparing the frame. (The
    contents of a resource that may still be in use in the GPU should not be
    touched, but simply always waiting for the previous frame to finish would
    reduce GPU utilization and ultimately, performance and efficiency.)

    Conceptually this is somewhat similar to copy-on-write schemes used by some
    C++ containers and other types. It may also be similar to what an OpenGL or
    Direct 3D 11 implementation performs internally for certain type of objects.

    In practice, such double (or triple) buffering resources is realized in
    the Vulkan, Metal, and similar QRhi backends by having a fixed number of
    native resource (such as, VkBuffer) \c slots behind a QRhiResource. That
    can then be indexed by a frame slot index running 0, 1, ..,
    FramesInFlight-1, and then wrapping around.

    All this is managed transparently to the users of QRhi. However,
    applications that integrate rendering done directly with the graphics API
    may want to perform a similar double or triple buffering of their own
    graphics resources. That is then most easily achieved by knowing the values
    of the maximum number of in-flight frames (retrievable via resourceLimit())
    and the current frame (slot) index (returned by this function).

    certain special cases, just like with beginFrame().

    \note The QRhiCommandBuffer stored to *cb is not owned by the caller.

    Rendering without a swapchain is possible as well. The typical use case is
    to use it in completely offscreen applications, e.g. to generate image
    sequences by rendering and reading back without ever showing a window.

    Usage in on-screen applications (so beginFrame, endFrame,
    beginOffscreenFrame, endOffscreenFrame, beginFrame, ...) is possible too
    but it does reduce parallelism so it should be done only infrequently.

    Offscreen frames do not let the CPU potentially generate another frame
    while the GPU is still processing the previous one. This has the side
    effect that if readbacks are scheduled, the results are guaranteed to be
    available once endOffscreenFrame() returns. That is not the case with
    frames targeting a swapchain: there the GPU is potentially better utilized,
    but working with readback operations needs more care from the application
    because endFrame(), unlike endOffscreenFrame(), does not guarantee that the
    results from the readback are available at that point.
