    \class QPageSetupDialog

    \brief The QPageSetupDialog class provides a configuration dialog
    for the page-related options on a printer.

    \ingroup standard-dialogs
    \ingroup printing
    \inmodule QtPrintSupport

    On Windows and Mac OS X the page setup dialog is implemented using
    the native page setup dialogs.

    Note that on Windows and Mac OS X custom paper sizes won't be
    reflected in the native page setup dialogs. Additionally, custom
    page margins set on a QPrinter won't show in the native Mac OS X
    page setup dialog.

    \sa QPrinter, QPrintDialog

    \fn QPageSetupDialog::QPageSetupDialog(QPrinter *printer, QWidget *parent)

    Constructs a page setup dialog that configures \a printer with \a
    parent as the parent widget.

    \fn QPageSetupDialog::QPageSetupDialog(QWidget *parent)
