libxkbcommon 0.8.2 - 2018-08-05
==================

- Fix various problems found with fuzzing (see commit messages for
  more details):

    - Fix a few NULL-dereferences, out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior
      in the XKB text format parser.


libxkbcommon 0.8.1 - 2018-08-03
==================

- Fix various problems found in the meson build (see commit messages for more
  details):

    - Fix compilation on Darwin.

    - Fix compilation of the x11 tests and demos when XCB is installed in a
      non-standard location.

    - Fix xkbcommon-x11.pc missing the Requires specification.

- Fix various problems found with fuzzing and Coverity (see commit messages for
  more details):

    - Fix stack overflow in the XKB text format parser when evaluating boolean
      negation.

    - Fix NULL-dereferences in the XKB text format parser when some unsupported
      tokens appear (the tokens are still parsed for backward compatibility).

    - Fix NULL-dereference in the XKB text format parser when parsing an
      xkb_geometry section.

    - Fix an infinite loop in the Compose text format parser on some inputs.

    - Fix an invalid free() when using multiple keysyms.

- Replace the Unicode characters for the leftanglebracket and rightanglebracket
  keysyms from the deprecated LEFT/RIGHT-POINTING ANGLE BRACKET to
  MATHEMATICAL LEFT/RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET.

- Reject out-of-range Unicode codepoints in xkb_keysym_to_utf8 and
  xkb_keysym_to_utf32.


libxkbcommon 0.8.0 - 2017-12-15
==================

- Added xkb_keysym_to_{upper,lower} to perform case-conversion directly on
  keysyms. This is useful in some odd cases, but working with the Unicode
  representations should be preferred when possible.

- Added Unicode conversion rules for the signifblank and permille keysyms.

- Fixed a bug in the parsing of XKB key type definitions where the number
  of levels were determined by the number of level *names*. Keymaps which
  omit level names were hence miscompiled.

  This regressed in version 0.4.3. Keymaps from xkeyboard-config were not
  affected since they don't omit level names.

- New API:
  xkb_keysym_to_upper()
  xkb_keysym_to_lower()


libxkbcommon 0.7.2 - 2017-08-04
==================

- Added a Meson build system as an alternative to existing autotools build
  system.

  The intent is to remove the autotools build in one of the next releases.
  Please try to convert to it and report any problems.

  See http://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html for basic usage, the
  meson_options.txt for the project-specific configuration options,
  and the PACKAGING file for more details.

  There are some noteworthy differences compared to the autotools build:

  - Feature auto-detection is not performed. By default, all features are
    enabled (currently: docs, x11, wayland). The build fails if any of
    the required dependencies are not available. To disable a feature,
    pass -Denable-<feature>=false to meson.

  - The libraries are either installed as shared or static, as specified
    by the -Ddefault_library=shared/static option. With autotools, both
    versions are installed by default.

  - xorg-util-macros is not used.

  - A parser generator (bison/byacc) is always required - there is no
    fallback to pre-generated output bundled in the tarball, as there is
    in autotools.

- Removed Android.mk support.

- Removed the *-uninstalled.pc pkgconfig files.

- Ported the interactive-wayland demo program to v6 of the xdg-shell
  protocol.

- Added new keysym definitions from xproto.

- New API:
  XKB_KEY_XF86Keyboard
  XKB_KEY_XF86WWAN
  XKB_KEY_XF86RFKill
  XKB_KEY_XF86AudioPreset


libxkbcommon 0.7.1 - 2017-01-18
==================

- Fixed various reported problems when the current locale is tr_TR.UTF-8.

  The function xkb_keysym_from_name() used to perform case-insensitive
  string comparisons in a locale-dependent way, but required it to to
  work as in the C/ASCII locale (the so called "Turkish i problem").

  The function is now no longer affected by the current locale.

- Fixed compilation in NetBSD.


libxkbcommon 0.7.0 - 2016-11-11
==================

- Added support for different "modes" of calculating consumed modifiers.
  The existing mode, based on the XKB standard, has proven to be
  unintuitive in various shortcut implementations.

  A new mode, based on the calculation used by the GTK toolkit, is added.
  This mode is less eager to declare a modifier as consumed.

- Added a new interactive demo program using the Wayland protocol.
  See the PACKAGING file for the new (optional) test dependencies.

- Fixed a compilation error on GNU Hurd.

- New API:
  enum xkb_consumed_mode
  XKB_CONSUMED_MODE_XKB
  XKB_CONSUMED_MODE_GTK
  xkb_state_key_get_consumed_mods2
  xkb_state_mod_index_is_consumed2


libxkbcommon 0.6.1 - 2016-04-08
==================

- Added LICENSE to distributed files in tarball releases.

- Minor typo fix in xkb_keymap_get_as_string() documentation.


libxkbcommon 0.6.0 - 2016-03-16
==================

- If the XKB_CONFIG_ROOT environment variable is set, it is used as the XKB
  configuration root instead of the path determined at build time.

- Tests and benchmarks now build correctly on OSX.

- An XKB keymap provides a name for each key it defines.  Traditionally,
  these names are limited to at most 4 characters, and are thus somewhat
  obscure, but might still be useful (xkbcommon lifts the 4 character limit).

  The new functions xkb_keymap_key_get_name() and xkb_keymap_key_by_name()
  can be used to get the name of a key or find a key by name.  Note that
  a key may have aliases.

- Documentation improvements.

- New API:
  xkb_keymap_key_by_name()
  xkb_keymap_key_get_name()


libxkbcommon 0.5.0 - 2014-10-18
==================

- Added support for Compose/dead keys in a new module (included in
  libxkbcommon). See the documentation or the
  xkbcommon/xkbcommon-compose.h header file for more details.

- Improved and reordered some sections of the documentation.

- The doxygen HTML pages were made nicer to read.

- Most tests now run also on non-linux platforms.

- A warning is emitted by default about RMLVO values which are not used
  during keymap compilation, which are most often a user misconfiguration.
  For example, "terminate:ctrl_alt_backspace" instead of
  "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp".

- Added symbol versioning for libxkbcommon and libxkbcommon-x11.
  Note: binaries compiled against this and future versions will not be
  able to link against the previous versions of the library.

- Removed several compatablity symbols from the binary (the API isn't
  affected). This affects binaries which

  1. Were compiled against a pre-stable (<0.2.0) version of libxkbcommon, and
  2. Are linked against the this or later version of libxkbcommon.

  Such a scenario is likely to fail already.

- If Xvfb is not available, the x11comp test is now correctly skipped
  instead of hanging.

- Benchmarks were moved to a separate bench/ directory.

- Build fixes from OpenBSD.

- Fixed a bug where key type entries such as "map[None] = Level2;" were
  ignored.

- New API:
  XKB_COMPOSE_*
  xkb_compose_*


libxkbcommon 0.4.3 - 2014-08-19
==================

- Fixed a bug which caused xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device() to misrepresent
  modifiers for some keymaps.

  https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/issues/9

- Fixed a bug which caused xkb_x11_keymap_new_from_device() to ignore XKB
  PrivateAction's.

- Modifiers are now always fully resolved after xkb_state_update_mask().
  Previously the given state components were used as-is, without
  considering virtual modifier mappings.
  Note: this only affects non-standard uses of xkb_state_update_mask().

- Added a test for xkbcommon-x11, "x11comp". The test uses the system's
  Xvfb server and xkbcomp. If they do not exist or fail, the test is
  skipped.

- Fixed memory leaks after parse errors in the XKB yacc parser.
  The fix required changes which are currently incompatible with byacc.


libxkbcommon 0.4.2 - 2014-05-15
==================

- Fixed a bug where explicitly passing "--enable-x11" to ./configure would
  in fact disable it (regressed in 0.4.1).

- Added @since version annotations to the API documentation for everything
  introduced after the initial stable release (0.2.0).

- Added a section to the documentation about keysym transformations, and
  clarified which functions perform a given transformation.

- XKB files which fail to compile during keymap construction can no longer
  have any effect on the resulting keymap: changes are only applied when
  the entire compilation succeeds.
  Note: this was a minor correctness issue inherited from xkbcomp.

- Fix an out-of-bounds array access in src/x11/util.c:adopt_atoms()
  error-handling code.
  Note: it seems impossible to trigger in the current code since the input
  size cannot exceed the required size.


libxkbcommon 0.4.1 - 2014-03-27
==================

- Converted README to markdown and added a Quick Guide to the
  documentation, which breezes through the most common parts of
  xkbcommon.

- Added two new functions, xkb_state_key_get_utf{8,32}(). They
  combine the operations of xkb_state_key_get_syms() and
  xkb_keysym_to_utf{8,32}(), and provide a nicer interface for it
  (espcially for multiple-keysyms-per-level).

- The xkb_state_key_get_utf{8,32}() functions now apply Control
  transformation: when the Control modifier is active, the string
  is converted to an appropriate control character.
  This matches the behavior of libX11's XLookupString(3), and
  required by the XKB specification:
  https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.html#Interpreting_the_Control_Modifier

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75892

- The consumed modifiers for a key are now calculated similarly
  to libX11. The previous behavior caused a bug where Shift would
  not cancel an active Caps Lock.

- Make xkbcommon-x11 work with the keymap reported by the XQuartz
  X server.

  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75798

- Reduce memory usage during keymap compilation some more.

- New API:
  xkb_state_key_get_consumed_mods()
  xkb_state_key_get_utf8()
  xkb_state_key_get_utf32()

- Deprecated API:
  XKB_MAP_COMPILE_PLACEHOLDER, XKB_MAP_NO_FLAGS
    use XKB_KEYMAP_NO_FLAGS instead.

- Bug fixes.


libxkbcommon 0.4.0 - 2014-02-02
==================

- Add a new add-on library, xkbcommon-x11, to support creating keymaps
  with the XKB X11 protocol, by querying the X server directly.
  See the xkbcommon/xkbcommon-x11.h header file for more details.
  This library requires libxcb-xkb >= 1.10, and is enabled by default.
  It can be disabled with the --disable-x11 configure switch.
  Distributions are encouraged to split the necessary files for this
  library (libxkbcommon-x11.so, xkbcommon-x11.pc, xkbcommon/xkbcommon-x11.h)
  to a separate package, such that the main package does not depend on
  X11 libraries.

- Fix the keysym <-> name lookup table to not require huge amounts of
  relocations.

- Fix a bug in the keysym <-> name lookup, whereby lookup might fail in
  some rare cases.

- Reduce memory usage during keymap compilation.

- New API:
  New keysyms from xproto 7.0.25 (German T3 layout keysyms).
  XKB_MOD_NAME_NUM for the usual NumLock modifier.
  xkb_x11_* types and functions, XKB_X11_* constants.


libxkbcommon 0.3.2 - 2013-11-22
==================

- Log messages from the library now look like "xkbcommon: ERROR" by
  default, instead of xkbcomp-like "Error:   ".

- Apply capitalization transformation on keysyms in
  xkb_keysym_get_one_sym(), to match the behavior specified in the XKB
  specification:
  https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.html#Interpreting_the_Lock_Modifier

- Support byacc for generating the parser, in addition to Bison.

- New API:
  XKB_KEY_XF86AudioMicMute keysym from xproto 7.0.24.
  XKB_KEYSYM_NO_FLAGS
  XKB_CONTEXT_NO_FLAGS
  XKB_MAP_COMPILE_NO_FLAGS

- Bug fixes.


libxkbcommon 0.3.1 - 2013-06-03
==================

- Replace the flex scanner with a hand-written one. flex is no longer
  a build requirement.

- New API:
  xkb_keymap_min_keycode()
  xkb_keymap_max_keycode()
  xkb_keymap_key_for_each()


libxkbcommon 0.3.0 - 2013-04-01
==================

- Allow passing NULL to *_unref() functions; do nothing instead of
  crashing.

- The functions xkb_keymap_num_levels_for_key() and
  xkb_keymap_get_syms_by_level() now allow out-of-range values for the
  'layout' parameter. The functions now wrap the value around the number
  of layouts instead of failing.

- The function xkb_keysym_get_name() now types unicode keysyms in
  uppercase and 0-padding, to match the format used by XKeysymToString().

- Building Linux-specific tests is no longer attempted on non-Linux
  environments.

- The function xkb_keymap_new_from_names() now accepts a NULL value for
  the 'names' parameter, instead of failing. This is equivalent to passing
  a 'struct xkb_rule_names' with all fields set to NULL.

- New API:
  xkb_keymap_new_from_buffer()

- Bug fixes.
