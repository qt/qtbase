but is maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software,
but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers.
It allows browsers to, for example:

- Avoid privacy-damaging \"supercookies\" being set for high-level domain name suffixes

- Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user interface

- Accurately sort history entries by site",
