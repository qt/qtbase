Contains the header and sources files from selected xcb libraries:

   libxcb-1.9.1 together with xcb-proto-1.8 (randr, render, shape, shm, sync,
       xfixes, xinerama sources)
   # libxkbcommon-x11 requires libxcb-xkb >= 1.10
   libxcb-1.10 together with xcb-proto-1.10 (xkb sources)
   libxcb-1.13 together with xcb-proto-1.13 (xinput sources with removed
       Pointer Barriers API and SendExtensionEvent API)
   libxcb-util-image-0.3.9
   libxcb-util-keysyms-0.3.9
   libxcb-util-renderutil-0.3.9
   libxcb-util-wm-0.3.9

The 'include' directory was obtained by compiling and installing all of the modules.
When upgrading the bundled xcb headers, they must be tested to run also with the
minimal supported libxcb version, which currently is 1.9.1.

Use the -qt-xcb configure option to use the files instead of system xcb libraries.
See src/plugins/platforms/xcb/README for details.
