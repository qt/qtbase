Contains the header and sources files from selected xcb libraries:

   libxcb-1.5 together with xcb-proto-1.6 (sync, xfixes, randr sources)
   libxcb-1.8.1 together with xcb-proto-1.8 (xkb sources)
   libxcb-util-image-0.3.9
   libxcb-util-keysyms-0.3.9
   libxcb-util-renderutil-0.3.8
   libxcb-util-wm-0.3.9

The 'include' directory was obtained by compiling and installing all of the modules.
They have been tested to run also with libxcb 1.5 (the oldest version we support).

Use the -qt-xcb configure option to use the files instead of system xcb libraries.
See src/plugins/platforms/xcb/README for details.
