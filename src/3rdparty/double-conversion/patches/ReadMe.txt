Files generated, by git format-patch, from a branch off the
double-conversion upstream's master branch, reflecting the changes to
files there before copying to this directory and its include/.  This
ensures that the upstream can take the changes most easily.

Although they have a CLA, our changes have never risen to the level of
having any standing at copyright or patent law; on that basis, they
accepted our patches up to 2020 in early 2021 and we may hope they
will do so again in future.
