    \brief An overview of the androiddeployqt tool and how to use it.
    \title The androiddeployqt Tool

    \target androiddeployqt
    Building an Android package involves many steps, so Qt comes with a tool which
    handles the work for you. The steps handled by the androiddeployqt
    tool are described in \l{Deploying an Application on Android}.

    \section1 Prerequisites Before Running androiddeployqt

    Before running the tool manually, you need to configure your project with
    \c CMake or \c qmake to generate \c Makefiles and a \c JSON file (i.e.
    \c{android-<target_name>-deployment-settings.json}) containing important settings
    used by \c androiddeployqt.

    \note It is not recommended to modify the androiddeployqt JSON file.

    To prepare the environment for androiddeployqt, configure your project in
    a separate directory than your source directory. For more information on
    configuring your project, see \l {Building Qt for Android Projects from Command Line}.

    \section1 Command Line Arguments

    The only required command line arguments when running the tool are
    \c {--input} and \c {--output}. Other command line arguments are optional but
    useful. The list below is available by passing the \c {--help} argument to
    androiddeployqt.

    \quotefromfile main.cpp
    \skipto Syntax: androiddeployqt --output <destination> [options]
    \printuntil --help: Displays this information.

    With a \c project_name, to build the application package with \c androiddeployqt
    without deploying it the device, run the following:

    \badcode
    androiddeployqt --input <build_dir>/android-project_name-deployment-settings.json \
                    --output <build_dir>/android-build
    \endcode

    To build and deploy the package to the device:

    \badcode
    androiddeployqt --input <build_dir>/android-project_name-deployment-settings.json \
                    --output <build_dir>/android-build --install --device <device_serial_id>
    \endcode

    \section1 Dependencies Detection

    Qt comes with a number of plugins which are loaded at run-time when they are
    needed. These can handle anything from connecting to SQL databases to loading
    specific image formats. Detecting plugin dependencies is impossible as the
    plugins are loaded at run-time, but androiddeployqt tries to guess such
    dependencies based on the Qt dependencies of your application. If the plugin
    has any Qt dependencies which are not also dependencies of your application,
    it will not be included by default. For instance, in order to ensure that
    the SVG image format plugin is included, you will need to add \l {Qt SVG}
    module to your project for it to become a dependency of your application:

    \badcode
    find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Svg)
    ...
    target_link_libraries(target_name PRIVATE Qt6::Svg)
    \endcode

    If you are wondering why a particular plugin is not included automatically,
    you can run androiddeployqt with the \c{--verbose} option to get the list of
    missing dependencies for each excluded plugin. You can achieve the same in
    \QC by ticking the \uicontrol {Verbose output} check box in the
    \uicontrol {Projects} > \uicontrol {Build Steps} > \uicontrol {Build Android APK} >
    \uicontrol {Advanced Actions}.

    It's also possible to manually specify the dependencies of your application.
    For more information, see \l {QT_ANDROID_DEPLOYMENT_DEPENDENCIES} CMake variable.

    \note androiddeployqt scans the QML files of the project to collect the QML imports.
    However, if you are loading QML code as a QString from C++ at runtime, that might
    not work properly because androiddeployqt won't be aware of it at deploy time.
    To remedy that, you can add a dummy QML file that imports such QML modules that
    are referenced at runtime.

    \section1 Deployment in \QC

    \QC uses \c androiddeployqt under the hood, and provides easy
    and intuitive user interfaces to specify various options. For more information,
    see \l{\QC: Android Deploy Configuration}.

    For more information about customizing and deploying a Qt for Android app,
    see \l {Deploying an Application on Android}.
