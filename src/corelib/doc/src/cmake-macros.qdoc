\title qt5_wrap_cpp

\brief Creates \c{.moc} files from sources.

\section1 Synopsis

\badcode
qt5_wrap_cpp(<VAR> src_file1 [src_file2 ...]
             [TARGET target]
             [OPTIONS ...]
             [DEPENDS ...])
\endcode

\section1 Description

Creates rules for calling \l{moc}{Meta-Object Compiler (moc)} on the given
source files. For each input file, an output file is generated in the build
directory. The paths of the generated files are added to\c{<VAR>}.

\note This is a low-level macro. See the \l{CMake AUTOMOC Documentation} for a
more convenient way to let source files be processed with \c{moc}.

\section1 Options

You can set an explicit \c{TARGET}. This will make sure that the target
properties \c{INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES} and \c{COMPILE_DEFINITIONS} are also used
when scanning the source files with \c{moc}.

You can set additional \c{OPTIONS} that should be added to the \c{moc} calls.
You can find possible options in the \l{moc}{moc documentation}.

\c{DEPENDS} allows you to add additional dependencies for recreation of the
generated files. This is useful when the sources have implicit dependencies,
like code for a Qt plugin that includes a \c{.json} file using the
Q_PLUGIN_METADATA() macro.

\title qt5_add_resources

\brief Compiles binary resources into source code.

\section1 Synopsis

\badcode
qt5_add_resources(<VAR> file1.qrc [file2.qrc ...]
                  [OPTIONS ...])
\endcode

\section1 Description

Creates source code from Qt resource files using the
\l{Resource Compiler (rcc)}. Paths to the generated source files are added to
\c{<VAR>}.

\note This is a low-level macro. See the \l{CMake AUTORCC Documentation} for a
more convenient way to let Qt resource files be processed with \c{rcc}.
For embedding bigger resources, see \l qt5_add_big_resources.

\section1 Arguments

You can set additional \c{OPTIONS} that should be added to the \c{rcc} calls.
You can find possible options in the \l{rcc}{rcc documentation}.

\title qt5_add_big_resources

\brief Compiles big binary resources into object code.

\section1 Synopsis

\badcode
qt5_add_big_resources(<VAR> file1.qrc [file2.qrc ...]
                      [OPTIONS ...])
\endcode

\section1 Description

Creates compiled object files from Qt resource files using the
\l{Resource Compiler (rcc)}. Paths to the generated files are added to
\c{<VAR>}.

This is similar to \l qt5_add_resources, but directly generates object
files (\c .o, \c .obj) files instead of C++ source code. This allows to
embed bigger resources, where compiling to C++ sources and then to
binaries would be too time consuming or memory intensive.

Note that this macro is only available if using \c{CMake} 3.9 or later.

\section1 Arguments

You can set additional \c{OPTIONS} that should be added to the \c{rcc} calls.
You can find possible options in the \l{rcc}{rcc documentation}.

\title qt5_add_binary_resources

\brief Creates an \c{RCC} file from a list of Qt resource files.

\section1 Synopsis

\badcode
qt5_add_binary_resources(target file1.qrc [file2.qrc ...]
                         [DESTINATION ...]
                         [OPTIONS ...])
\endcode

\section1 Description

Adds a custom \c target that compiles Qt resource files into a binary \c{.rcc}
file.

\section1 Arguments

\c{DESTINATION} sets the path of the generated \c{.rcc} file. The default is
\c{${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${target}.rcc}.

You can set additional \c{OPTIONS} that should be added to the \c{rcc} calls.
You can find possible options in the \l{rcc}{rcc documentation}.

\brief Calls moc on an input file.

\section1 Synopsis

\badcode
qt5_generate_moc(src_file dest_file
                 [TARGET target])
\endcode

\section1 Description

Creates a rule to call the \l{moc}{Meta-Object Compiler (moc)} on \c src_file
and store the output in \c dest_file.

\note This is a low-level macro. See the \l{CMake AUTOMOC Documentation} for a
more convenient way to let source files be processed with \c{moc}.
\l qt5_wrap_cpp is also similar, but automatically generates a temporary file
path for you.

\section1 Arguments

You can set an explicit \c{TARGET}. This will make sure that the target
properties \c{INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES} and \c{COMPILE_DEFINITIONS} are also used
when scanning the source files with \c{moc}.

\title qt5_import_plugins

\brief Specifies a custom set of plugins to import for a static Qt build

\section1 Synopsis

\badcode
qt5_import_plugins(target
                   [INCLUDE plugin ...]
                   [EXCLUDE plugin ...]
                   [INCLUDE_BY_TYPE plugin_type plugin ...]
                   [EXCLUDE_BY_TYPE plugin_type])
\endcode

\section1 Description

Specifies a custom set of plugins to import. The optional arguments:
\c INCLUDE, \c EXCLUDE, \c INCLUDE_BY_TYPE, and \c EXCLUDE_BY_TYPE,
can be used more than once.

This CMake command was introduced in Qt 5.14.

\list
\li \c INCLUDE -- can be used to specify a list of plugins to import.
\li \c EXCLUDE -- can be used to specify a list of plugins to exclude.
\li \c INCLUDE_BY_TYPE -- can be used to override the list of plugins to
       import for a certain plugin type.
\li \c EXCLUDE_BY_TYPE -- can be used to specify a plugin type to exclude;
       then no plugins of that type are imported.
\endlist

Qt provides plugin types such as \c imageformats, \c platforms,
and \c sqldrivers.

If \c qt5_import_plugins() isn't called, the target automatically links against
a sane set of default plugins, for each Qt module that the target is linked
against. For more information, see
\l{CMake target_link_libraries Documentation}{target_link_libraries}.

Each plugin comes with a C++ stub file that automatically
initializes the plugin. Consequently, any target that links against a plugin
has this C++ file added to its \c SOURCES.

\note This macro imports plugins from static Qt builds only.
On shared builds, it does nothing.

\section1 Example

\snippet cmake-macros/examples.cmake qt5_import_plugins

In the snippet above, the following occurs with the executable \c myapp:

\list
\li The \c Qt5::QCocoaIntegrationPlugin is imported into myapp.
\li The \c Qt5::QMinimalIntegrationPlugin plugin is
    excluded from being automatically imported into myapp.
\li The default list of plugins for \c imageformats is
    overridden to only include Qt5::QGifPlugin and Qt5::QJpegPlugin.
\li All \c sqldrivers plugins are excluded from automatic importing.
\endlist
