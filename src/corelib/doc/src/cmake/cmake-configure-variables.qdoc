\summary {Enables building multi-ABI packages using the autodetected Qt for Android SDK list.}

\cmakevariablesince 6.3
\preliminarycmakevariable
\cmakevariableandroidonly

The option automatically detects available ABIs of Qt for Android and uses them to
build a package. The automatic detection expects the default directory structure
supplied by the Qt installer, with the corresponding naming of the directories.
\include cmake-android-supported-abis.qdocinc
The typical directory structure looks as below:
\badcode
/path/to/Qt/6.x.x
    android_armv7
    android_arm64_v8a
    android_x86
    android_x86_64
    ...
\endcode
The auto-detected paths can be customized using one of \c{QT_PATH_ANDROID_ABI_<ABI>} variables.

The variable is set to FALSE by default.

This variable specifies a list of ABIs to be used to build the project packages.

Each ABI should have the corresponding Qt for Android either installed or
user-built. It's possible to specify the path to the Qt for Android ABI using
the corresponding \c{QT_PATH_ANDROID_ABI_<ABI>} variable.

\note \c{QT_ANDROID_BUILD_ALL_ABIS} has the higher priority and ignores the
QT_ANDROID_ABIS logic.

Enables verbose mode of the \l androiddeployqt deployment tool when it is called
internally at build time, usually during target finalization.

This variable also changes the default verbosity of install-time deployment

must be set before the first \c{find_package(Qt6)} call to have that effect.

\note The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.

This configure-phase variable is set by the Core package. It is intended to be
used as the first line of any deployment script to ensure access to the
deployment APIs provided by Qt. Such deployment scripts do not run during
CMake's configure phase, they are executed during installation or as
part of a post-build rule.

The following example shows one way the variable would be used when installing
an application, along with its runtime dependencies:

\include cmake-deploy-runtime-dependencies.qdocinc

\cmakevariablesince 6.3
\preliminarycmakevariable

The \l{qt6_standard_project_setup}{qt_standard_project_setup()} command is
typically called in the top level \c{CMakeLists.txt} file of a project. In some
scenarios, such projects may be absorbed as a child project of a larger project
hierarchy. A parent project may want to prevent any child project from applying
changes to the setup. The parent project can achieve this by setting
\c{QT_NO_STANDARD_PROJECT_SETUP} to true before bringing in the child project
via \l{add_subdirectory()}, \l{FetchContent_MakeAvailable()} or other similar
methods provided by CMake.
