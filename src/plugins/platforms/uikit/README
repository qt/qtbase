This is a proof-of-concept implemenation of a UIKit based
QPA plugin. Note that this is completely unsupported, and it is probable
that many parts of QtCore and other Qt Modules don't work properly.

1) Build Qt

The example Xcode project in the examples subdirectory requires that you do shadow
builds of Qt in qt-lighthouse-ios-simulator and qt-lighthouse-ios-device directories
parallel to the sources. To build for simulator make sure that both the Simulator
configuration *and* the simulator specific target are active. To build for device
make sure that both the Device configuration *and* the device specific target are
active.

The setup is configured to use the iOS 4.2 SDKs, you might want to edit the mkspecs
to fit your need.

After configuring and building Qt you need to also build src/plugins/platforms/uikit.

Simulator:
----------
configure -qpa -xplatform qws/macx-iphonesimulator-g++ -arch i386 -developer-build -opengl es1 -no-accessibility -no-qt3support -no-multimedia -no-phonon -no-phonon-backend -no-svg -no-webkit -no-scripttools -no-openssl -no-sql-mysql -no-sql-odbc -no-cups -no-iconv -no-dbus -static -nomake tools -nomake docs -nomake examples -nomake translations

Device:
-------
configure -qpa -xplatform qws/macx-iphonedevice-g++ -arch armv7 -developer-build -release -opengl es1 -no-accessibility -no-qt3support -no-multimedia -no-phonon -no-phonon-backend -no-svg -no-webkit -no-scripttools -no-openssl -no-sql-mysql -no-sql-odbc -no-cups -no-iconv -no-dbus -static -nomake tools -nomake docs -nomake examples -nomake translations

2) XCode setup:
- there are examples in the examples subdirectory of the platform plugin
- to create something fresh do something like:
  - Xcode: Create a "View-based Appplication"
  - remove the nibs and view controller and app controller files
  - remove the reference to "Main nib file" from plist file
  - create a main.mm like in the examples
  - add the qmlapplicationviewer sources to your project (including the moc_*.h)
    (best to link, not copy), the code for this is from the Qt Creator
    mobile Qt Quick application template
  - Add the Qt .a libraries, uikit platform plugin and libz (v1.2.3) to Frameworks
  - add "$(SRCROOT)/../../../../qt-lighthouse-ios-device/include" (or -simulator)
    to the include search paths.
  - add "$(SRCROOT)/../qmltest" to the include search path if you didn't copy but
    linked to the qmlapplicationviewer
  - for device set the architecture to armv7 only

3) Done: Build and Run.
